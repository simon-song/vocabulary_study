Though for no other reason, yet for this, I am writing this so that posterity
may know we have not loosely through silence permitted things to pass as in a
dream, that there shall be extant information about the current state of the
Church of England and people's endeavor to uphold it.

At your hands, our beloved brethrens in our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, 
(for in him we bear the love to all that seem to be born of him, and this love
would not be drown by the sea of your gall and bitterness),
I have no great cause to expect anything less than the same asperity 
which you give to people who do not concur in opinion with you.


I have to admit that before I examined your sundry declarations on that behalf

affected and most religious minds showed great earnestness to their cause,
they must have something important to say.

To Those Who Seek to Reform the Ecclesiastical Laws and Orders in the Church of
England

Though for no other cause, yet for this; I am writing this so that posterity may
know we have not loosely through silence permitted things to pass away as in a
dream, that there shall be extant information concerning the present state of
the Church of England and people's endeavor to uphold it.

[Q: Why H. invokes posterity instead of addressing Purians directly?]

At your hands, our beloved brethrens in our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, (for in
him we bear the love unto all that seem to be born of him, this love which shall
never be drown by your gall and bitterness), I expect nothing but the usual
asperity which you lay on people who do not concur in opionion with you.

But our hope is, the the God of peace shall (amid man's nature of being
impatient of contumelious malediction) enable us to quietly and even gladly to
suffer all this, for the sake of the work we covet to perform.

The wonderful zeal and fervor which you have withstood the received orders of
this Church, was the first thing which caused me to consider, whether (as all
your published books and writings peremptorily maintain) every Christian,
fearing God, is bound to join with you for the furtherance of what you call the
"Lord's Discipline". 

I have to admit, before I examined your sundry declarations on that behalf, I
could not help thinking that there must be some marvelous reasons for so many 
otherwise well affected and religious people to behavior so earnestly that way.

To Those Who Seek to Reform the Ecclesiastical Laws and Orders in the Church of
England

Though for no other cause, yet for this; that posterity may know we have not
loosely through silence permitted things to pass away as in a dream, that there
shall be extant information about people who care so much about the
present state of the the Church of England, and their careful endeavor which
would have upheld it.

At your hands, our beloved brethrens by our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, (for
in him we bear the love unto all that would but seem to be born of him, which
the sea of your gall and bitterness shall never drown,) I have no great cause to
expect anything other than your usual portion and lot, which you have lay on
those whom do not concur in opionion and sentence with you.

But our hope is, that the God of peace shall (notwithstanding man's nature too
impatient of contumelious malediction) enable us to suffer all things quietly
and even gladly, for the sake of that work we covet to perform.

2017-7-4  Paraphrase of Hooker, Preface I.2

The wonderful zeal and fervor with which you have withstood the received order
of this Church, was the first thing which caused me to enter into consideration,
whether (as all your published books and writings peremptorily maintain) every
God-fearing Christian stand bound to join with you for the furtherance of that
which you term the Lord's Discipline.

===============================================================
Burke, Present State of the Nation, re-typed

Party divisions, whether on the whole operating for good or evil, are things
inseparable from free government. This is a truth, I believe, admit little
disputes, having been established by the uniform experience of all ages. The
part a good citizen ought to take in these divisions has been a matter of much
deeper controversy. But God forbid that any controversy relating to our
essential morals should admit of no decision. It appears to me, that this
question, like most of the others which regard our duties in life, is to be
determined by our station in it. Private men may be wholly neutral, and entirely
innocent: but they who are legally invested with public trust, or stand on the
high ground of rank and dignity, which is trust implied, can hardly in any case
remain indifferent, without the certainty of sinking into insignificance; and
thereby in effect deserting that post in which, with the fullest authority, and
for the wisest purposes, the laws and institutions of their country have fixed
them. However, if it be the office of those who are thus circumscribed, to take
a decied part, it is no less their duty that it should be a sorber one. It ought
to be circumscribed by the same laws of decorum, and balanced by the same
temper, which bound and regulate all the virtures. In a word, we ought to act in
party with all the moderation which does not absolutely enervate that vigor, and
quench that fervency of spirity, without which the best wishes for the public
good must evaporate in empty speculation.

It is probably from some such motives that the friends of a very respectable
party in this kingdom have been hitherto silent. For these two years past, from
one and the same quarter of politics, a continual fire has been kept upon them;
sometimes from the unwieldly column of quartos and octavos; sometimes from the
light squadrons of occasional pamphlets and flying sheets. Every month has
brought on its periodical calumny. The abuse has take every shape which the
ability of the writers could give it; plain invective, clumsy raillery,
misrepresented anecdote. No method of vilifying the measures, the abilities, the
intentions, or the persons which compose that body, has been omitted.

On their part nothing was opposed but patience and character. It was a matter of
the most serious and indignant affliction to persons who thought themselves in
conscience bound to oppose a ministery dangerous from its very constitution, as
well as its measures, to find themselves, whenever they faced their adversaries,
continually attacked on the rear by a set of men who pretended to be actuated by
motives similar to theirs. They saw that the plan long pursued, with but too
fatal a success, was to break the strength of this kingdom, by frittering down
the bodies which compose it, by fomenting bitter and sanguinary animosities, and
by dissolving every tie of social affection and public trust. These virtuous
men, such I am warranted by public opinion to call them, were resolved rather to
endure everything, than co-operate in that design. A diversity of opionion upon
almost every principle of politics had indeed drawn a string line of separation
between them and some others. However, they were desirous not to extend the
misfortune by unnecessary bitterness; they wished to prevent a difference of
opinion on the commonwealth from festering into rancorous and incurable
hostility. Accordingly they endeavored that all past controversies should be
forgotten; and that enough for the day should be the evil thereof. There is
however a limit at which forbearance ceases to be a virtue. Mena may tolerate
injuries whilst they are only personal to themselves. But it is not the first of
virtues to bear with moderation the indignities that are offered to our country.
A piece has at lenght appeared, from the quarter of all the former attacks,
which upon every public consideration demands an answer. Whilst persons more
equal to this buisiness may be engaged in affairs of greater moment, I hope I
shall be excused, if, in a few hours of a time not very important, and from such
materials as I have by me (more than enough however for this purpose), I
undertake to set the facts and arguments of this wonderful performance in a
proper light. I will endeavor to state what this piece is; the purpose for which
I take it to have been written; and the effects (supposing it should have any
effect at all) it must necessarily produce.

This piece is called "The Present State of the Nation". It may be considered as
a sort of digest of the avowed maxims of a certain political school, the effects
of whose doctrines and practices this country will fuel long and severely. It is
made up of a farrago of almost every topic which has been agitated on national
affairs in parliamentary debate, or provate conversation, for these last seven
years. The oldest controversies are hauled out of the dust with which time and
neglect had covered them. Arguments ten times repeated, a thousand times
answered before, are here repeated again. Public accounts formerly printed and
reprinted revolve once more, and find their old station in this sober meridian.
All the commonplace lamentations upon the decay of trade, the increase of taxes,
and the high price of labor and provisions, are here retailed again and again in
the same tone with which they have drawled through columns of Gazetteers and
Advertisers for a century together. Paradoxes which affront common sense, and
uninsteresting barren truths which generate no conclusion, are thrown in to
augment unwieldy bulk, without adding anything to weight. Because two
accusations are better than one, contradictions are set staring one another in
the face, without even an attempt to reconcile them. And, to give the whole a
sort of portentuous air of labor and information, the table of the House of
Commons is swept into this grand reservoir of politics.

......

Such is the author's scheme. Whether it will answer his purpose I know not. But
surely that purpose ought to be a wonderfully good one, to warrant the methods
he has taken to compass it. If the facts and reasonings in this piece are
admitted, it is all over with us. The continuance of our tranquillity depends on
the compassion of our rivals. Unable to secure to ourselves the advantanges of
peace, we are at the same time utterly unfit for war. It is impossible, if the
state of things be credited abroad, that we can have any alliance; all nations
will fly from so dangerous a connection, lest, instead of partakers of our
strength, they should only become sharers in our ruin. If it is believed at
home, all that firmness of mind, and dignified national courage, which used to
be the great support of this isle against the powers of the world, must melt
away, and fail within us.

In such a state of things can it be amiss if I aim at holding out some comfort
to the nation; another sort of comfort, indeed, than that which this writer
provides for it; a comfort not from its physician, but from its constitution: if
I attempt to show that all the arguments upon which he founds the decay of that
constitution, and the necessity of that physician, are vain and frivolous?
I will follow the author closely in his own long career, through the war, the
peace, the finances, our trade, and our foreign politics: not for the sake of
the particular measures which he discusses; that can be of no use; they are all
decided; their good is all enjoyed, or their evil incurred: but for the sake of
the principles of war, peace, trade, and finances.  These principles are of
infinite moment. They must come again and again under consideration; and it
imports the public, of all things, that those of its ministers be enlarged, and
just, and well confirmed, upon all these subjects. What notions this author
entertains we shall see presently; notions in my opinion very irrational, and
extremely dangerous; and which, if they should crawl from pamphlets into
counsels, and be realized from private speculation into national measures,
cannot fail of hastening and completing our ruin.

This author, after having paid his compliment to the showy appearances of the
late war in our favor, is in the utmost haste to tell you that these appearances
were fallacious, that they were no more than an imposition. -- I fear I must
trouble the reader with a pretty long quotation, in order to set before him the
more clearly this author's peculiar way of conceiving and reasoning:

......

If any one be willing to see to how much greater lengths the author carries
these ideas, he will recur to the book. This is sufficient for a speciment of
his manner of thinking. I believe one reflection uniformly obtrudes itself upon
every reader of these paragraphs. For what purpose, in any cause, shall we
hereafter contend with France? Can we ever flatter ourselves that we shall wage
a more successful war? If, on our part, in a war the most prosperous we ever
carried on, by sea and by land, and in every part of the globe, attended with
the unparalleled circumstance of an immense increase of trade and augmentation
of revenue; if a continued series of disappointments, disgraces, and defeats,
followed by public bankruptcy, on the part of France; if all these still leave
her a gainer on the whole balance, will it not be downright frenzy in us ever to
look her in the face again, or to contend with her any, even the most essential
points, since victory and defeat, though by different ways, equally conduct us
to be more for our advantage. According to his representation of things, the
question is only concerning the most easy fall. France had not discovered, our
statesman tells us, at the end of that war, the triumphs of defeat, and the
resources which are derived from bankruptcy. For my poor part, I do not wonder
at their blindness. But the English ministers saw further. Our author has at
length let foreigners also into the secret, and made them altogether as wise as
ourselves. It is their own fault if (vulgato imperii arcano) they are imposed
upon any longer. They now are apprised of the sentiments which the great
candidate for the government of this great empire entertains; and they will act
accordingly. They are taught our weakness and their own advantages.

The difficulty of writing the first address is felt by many writers and a new 
method for writing it is strongly desired.

Most authors wish that they have already established the first address long ago
to avoid the dangers produced from the desire of pleasing the audience.

Many epic writers mimicked the opening of Homer.

But this mimicking has not extened to inferior literature.

It is wise to follow Horace's advice to be modest about one's own writing.

But there are still many writers who believe too much on their own writings.

It may be as dangerous to claim too little for one's writing.

It is acceptable for an author entering the world to praise himself.

Similar to the case in love, a new author will be better off if he keeps a low
profile before gaining the favor of the public.

It is understandable for new authors to do certain things to attract favors.

Diurnal writers have the advantage that the quality of their writing 
can be easily distinguished.

This is one of the many reasons I propose to present one short essay every 
Tuesday and Saturday to the public.

There are many conveniencies to this method of publication, one of the most
important being its flexibility to follow current event and taste.

The other advantage of this method is that due to its short length the author is
more likely to find enough things to say, and he can change direction or give up
the project if it does not work out.

It was the manner of those times (whether through men's desire to enjoy alone
the glory of their own enterprises, or else because the quickness of their
occasions required present dispatch, so it was,) that every particular church
did that within itself, which some few of their own thought good, by whom the
rest were all directed. Such number of churches then being, though free within
itself, yet small, common conferences beforehand might have eased them of much
after trouble. But a greater inconvenience it bred, that every after endeavoured
to be certain degrees more removed from conformity with the Church of Rome, than
the rest before had been. Which, notwithstanding, might have easily been
prevented, if the orders, which every church did think fit and convenient 
for itself, had not so peremptorily been established under that high commanding
form, which tendered them unto the people, as things everlastingly required by
the law of that Lord of lords, against whose statutes there is no exception to
be taken. For by this mean it came to pass, that one church could not but blame
and condemn another of disobedience to the will of Christ, in those things where
manifest difference was between them: whereas the selfsame orders allowed, but
yet established in more wary and suspense manner, as being to stand in force
till God would give the opportunity of some general conference what might be the
best for each of them afterwards to do. This I say had both prevented all
occasion of just dislike which others might take, and reserved a greated liberty
unto the authors themselves of entering into farther consulation afterwards.

accept, is only by error and misconceit named the ordinance of Jesus Christ, no
one proof as yet brought forth, whereby it may clearly appear to be so in very

The explication of which two things I have here thought good to offer into your
own hands, heartily beseeching you even by the meekness of Jesus Christ, whom I
trust ye love, that, as ye tender the peace and quietness of this Church, if
there be in you that gracious humility which hath ever been the crown and glory
of a Christianly-disposed mind, if your own souls, hearts, and consciences (the
sound integrity whereof can but hardly stand with the refusal of truth in
personal respects) be, as I doubt not but they are, things most dear and
precious unto you, let "not the faith which ye have be blemished" by
"partialities", regard not who it is which speaketh, but weigh only what is
spoken. Think not that ye read the words of one who bendeth himself as an
adversary against the truth which ye have already embraced, but the words of one
who desireth to embrace together with you the selfsame truth, if it be the
truth. And for that cause (for no other, God himself know,) hath undertaken the
burthensome labour of this painful kind of conference. For the plainer access
whereunto, let it be lawful for me to rip up the very bottom, how and by whom
your discipline was planted, at such time as this age we live in began to take
first trial thereof.

A founder it had, whom for mine own part, I think incomparably the wisest man
that ever the French church did enjoy, since the hour it enjoyed him. His
bringing up was in the study of the civil law. Divine knowledge he gathered, not
by hearing and reading so much, as by teaching others. For though thousands were
debtors to him, as touching knowledge of that kind, yet he to none but only to
God, the author of that most blessed fountain, the Book of Life, and of the
admirable dexerity of wit, together with the helps of other learning which were
his guides: till being occasioned to leave France, he fell at the length upon
Geneva, which city the bishop and clergy had a little before (as some do affirm)
forsaken, being of likelihood frightened with the people's sudden attempt for
abolishment of popish religion, the event of which enterprise they thought it
not safe for themselves to wait for in that place. At the coming of Calvin
thither, the form of their civil regiment was popular, as it continueth at this
day, neither king, nor duke, nor nobleman of any authority and power over them,
but officers chosen by the people yearly out of themselves, to order all things
with public consent. For spiritual government, they had no laws at all agreed
upon, but did what the pastors of their souls by persuasion could win them unto.
Calvin, being admitted one of their preachers and a divinity reader amongst
them, considered how dangerous it was that the whole estate of that church
should hang still on so slender a thread as the liking of an ignorant multitude
is, if it have the power to change whatsoever itself listeth. Wherefore taking
unto him two of the ministers for more countenance (albeit the rest were all
against it) they moved, and in the end persuaded with much ado, the people to
bind in solemn oath, first never to admit the papacy amongst them again, and
secondly, to live in obedience unto such orders concerning the exercise of their
religion, and the form of their ecclesiastical government, as those their true
and faithful ministers of God's word had agreeably to scripture set down for
that end and purpose.

When these things began to be put in ure, the people also (what causes moving
them thereunto, themselves best know) began to repent them of that they had
done, and irefully to champ unto the bit they had taken into their mouths; the
rather, for that they grew by means of this innovation into dislike of some
churches near about them, the benefit of whose good friendship they could not
well lack.

===========================================================================
You are pleased to call again, and with some earnestness, for my thoughts on 
the late proceedings in France. I will not give you reason to imagine that I
think my sentiments of such value as to wish myself to be solicited about them.
They are of too little consequence to be very anxiously either communicated or
withheld. It was from attention to you, and to you only, that I hesitated at the
time when you first desired to receive them. In the first letter I had the honor
to write to you, and which at length I sent, I wrote neither for nor from any
description of men; nor shall I in this. My errors, if any, are my own. My
reputation alone is to answer them.

My paraphrase: first try

You were pleased to call again, for my thoughts on the latest proceedings in
France. I do not believe my sentiments are of such importance. They were of
little importance to be either communicated or withheld. It is to you, and to
you only that I will give out my opinions. 
[something about the last letter?]
The errors, if any, were my own, and my reputation was the only thing to suffer.

second try:
You are pleased to call, and with some earnestness, for my thoughts on the late
proceedings in France. I don't think my sentiments to be so important to be
solicited when I received your first letter. They are of little importance to 
be either communicated or withheld. It is for you, and for you only that I wrote
my first reply, and at length sent to you. My errors, if any, are my own, and my
reputation is the only thing to suffer.

Again Burke's version:
You are pleased to call again, and with some earnestness, for my thoughts on the
late proceedings in France. I will not give you reason to imagine that I think

Rambler #18, para. 2:

This general unhappiness has given occasion to many sage maxims among the
serious, and smart remarks among the gay; the moralist and the writer of
epigrams have equally shewn their abilities upon it; some have lamented, and
some have ridiculed it; but as the faculty of writing has been chiefly a
masculine endowment, the reproach of making the world miserable has been always
thrown upon the women, and the grave and the merry have equally thought
themselves at liberty to conclude either with declamatory complaints, or
satirical censure, of female folly or fickleness, ambition or cruelty,
extravagance or lust.

Led by such a number of examples, and incited by my share in the common
interest, I sometimes venture to consider this universal grievance, having
endeavoured to divest my heart of all partiality, and place myself as a kind of
neutral being between sexes, whose clamours being equally vented on both sides
with all the vehemence of distress, all the apparent confidence of justice, and
all the indignation of injured virtue, seem entitled to equal regard.

The mean have, indeed, by their superiority of writing, been able to collect the
evidence of many ages, and raise prejudices in their favour by the venerable
testimonies of philosophers, historians, and poets; but the pleas of the ladies
appeal to passions of more forcible operation than the reverence of antiquity.

If they have not so great names on their side, they have stronger arguments: it
is to little purpose that Socrates, or Euripides, are produced against the sighs
of softness, and the tears of beauty.

The most frigid and inexorable judge would at least stand suspended between

Middlemarch, Prelude

Who that cares much to know the history of man, and how the mysterious mixture
behaves under the varying experiments of Time, has not dwelt, at least briefly,
on the life of Saint Theresa, has not smiled with some gentleness at the thought
of the little girl walking forth one morning hand-in-hand with her still smaller
brother, to go and seek martyrdom in the country of the Moors?

Many Theresas have been born who found for themselves no epic life wherein there
was a constant unfolding of far-resonant action; perhaps only a life of
mistakes, the offspring of a certain spiritual grandeur ill-matched with the
meanness of opportunity; perhaps a tragic failure which found no sacred poet and
sank unwept into oblivion.

Their ardour alternated between a vague ideal and the common yearning of

condemned as a lapse.

circumstance of an immense increase of trade and augumentation of revenue; if a
continued series of disappointments, disgraces, and defeats, followed by public
bankrupcy, on the part of France; if all these still leave her a gainer on the

consonant unto the word of God, without any cautions, qualifications, ifs or
ands; the other an earnest admonition to not innovate or change the same.

It is never without very melancholy reflections, that we can observe the
misconduct, or miscarriage, of those men, who seem, by the force of
misunderstanding, or extent of knowledge, exempted from the general frailities
of human nature, and privileged from the common infelicities of life.

17b. Indicating the maker or author of a work: Made, written, painted by. Often
     expressed by the possessive case, as 'The tragedies of Shakespeare',

Rambler #20

Among all my female friends, there was none who gave me more trouble to decypher
her true character, than Penthesilea, whose letter lay upon my desk three days
before I could fix upon the real writer. There was a confusion of images, and
medley of barbarity, which held me long in suspense; till by perseverance I
disentangled the perplexity, and found that Penthesilea is the son of a wealthy
stock-jobber, who spends his morning under his father's eye in Changed-Alley,
dines at a tavern in Covent-Garden, passes his evening in the play-house, and
part of the night at a gaming-table, and having learned the dialects of these
various regions, has mingled them all in a studied composition.

Hooker's text:

Which answer, although not answering unto the former demands, but respecting
what Master Calvin had judged requisite for them to answer, was notwithstanding
accepted with any further reply: in as much as they plainly saw, that when
stomach doth strive with wit, the match is not equal. And so the heat of their
former contentions began to slake.

The present inhabitants of Geneva, I hope, will not take it in evil parts, that
the faultiness of their people heretofore is by us so far forth laid open, as
their own learned guides and pastors have thought necessary to discover it unto
the world. For out of their books and writings it is that I have collected this
whole narration, to the end it might thereby appear in what sort amongst them
that discipline was planted, for which so much contention is raised amongst
ourselves. The reason which moved Calvin herein to be so earnest, was, as Beza
himself testifieth, "For that he saw how needful these bridles were, to be put
in the jaws of that city." That which by wisdom he saw to be requisite for that
people, was by as great wisdom compassed.

Calvin therefore sent with all expedition his letters unto some principal pastor
in every of those cities, craving earnestly at their hands, to respect this
cause as a thing whereupon the whole state of religion and piety did so much 
depend, that God and all good men would be inevitably certain to be trampled 
under foot, unless those four cities by their good means might be brought to 
give their sentence with the ministers of Geneva, when the cause should be
brought before them: yea so to give it, that two things it might effectually
contain, the one an absolute approbation of the discipline of Geneva as
consonant to the word of God, without any cautions, qualifications, ifs or ands;
the other an earnest admonition not to innovate or change the same. His vehement
request herein concerning both points was satisfied. For albeit the said
Helvetian churches did never as yet observe that discipline, nevertheless, the
Senate of Geneva having required their judgment on these three questions: First,
"About what manner, by God's commandament, according to the scripture and
unspotted religion, excommunication is to be exercised?" Secondly, "Whether it
may not be exercised some other way than by the consistory?" Thirdly, "What the
use of their Churches was to do in this case?" answer was returned from the said
churches, "that they had already heard of those consistorical laws, and did
acknowledge them to be godly ordinances drawing towards the prescript of the
word of God, for which cause they did not think it good for the Church of Geneva
by innovation to change the same, but rather to keep the things as they were."
Which answer, although not answering unto the former demands, but respecting
what Master Calvin had judged requisite for them to answer, was notwithstanding
accepted without further reply, in as much as they plainly saw, that when

desirous of all kind of furtherances unto his cause, could espy in the whole
Scripture of God nothing which would breed at the least a probable opinion of
likelihood, that divine authority itself was the same way somewhat inclinable.
But all which the wit even of Calvin was able from thence to draw, by sifting
the very utmost sentence and syllable, was no more than that certain speeches
there are which to him did seem to intimate that all Christian churches ought to
have their Elderships endued with power of excommunication, and a part of those
Elderships should be chosen out from amongst the laity, after the form which
himself had framed Geneva unto. And what argument are ye able to shew, whereby
it was ever proved by Calvin, that any sentence of Scripture doth necessarily
enforce these things, and the rest wherein your opinion concurreth with his
against the orders of your own church?

For albeit the said churches did never as yet observe that discipline,
nevertheless, the Senate of Geneva having required their judgment concerning
these three questions: Firstly, "After what manner, by God's commandaments,
according to Scripture and unspotted religion, excommunication is to be
exercised;" Secondly, "whether it may not be exercised some other way than by
the Consistory;" And thirdly, "what the use of their churches was to do in this
case." answer was returned from the said churches, "that they had heard already
of those consistory laws, and did acknowledge them to be godly ordinances
drawing towards the prescript of the word of God, for which reason they did not
think it good to change by innovation the same, but rather keep things as they
were." Which answer, although not answering unto their formal demands, but
respecting what Master Calvin had judged requisite for them to answer, was
notwithstanding accepted without any further reply, in as much as they plainly
saw, that when stomach doth strive with wit, the match is not equal. And so the

We should be injurious unto virtue itself, if we did derogate from them whom
their industry had made great. Two things of principal moment have deservedly
procured him honour throughout the world: the one his exceeding pains in
composing the Institutions of Christian Religion, the other his no less
industrious travails for exposition of holy Scripture according unto the same
Institutions. In which two things whosoever they were which after him bestowed
their labour, he gained the advantage of prejudice against them, if they
gainsayed; and of glory above them, if they consented. His writings after the
question about that discipline was once begun omit not the least occasion of
extolling the use and singular necessity thereof. Of what account the Master of
Sentences was in the Church of Rome, the same and more amongst the preachers of
reformed churches Calvin had purchased, so that the perfectest divines were
judged they, which were skillfullest in Calvin's writings. His books almost the
very canon to judge both doctrine and discipline by. French churches, both under
others abroad and at home in their own country, all cast to the mould which
Calvin had made. The Church of Scotland in erecting their own reformation took
the selfsame pattern. Till at length the discipline, which at the first was so
weak, that without the staff of their approbation, who were not subject unto it
themselves, it had not brought others under subjection, began to challenge
universal obedience, and to enter open conflict with those very churches, which
in desperate extremity had been relieves of it.

To one of those churches which lived in most peaceable sort, and abounded as
well with men for their learning in other professions singular, as also with
divines whose equals were not elsewhere to be found, a church ordered by
Gualter's discipline, and not by that which Geneva adoreth; unto this church,
the Church of Heidelberg, there cometh one who craving leave to dispute publicly
defendeth, with open disdain of their government, that "to a minister with his 
Eldership power is given by the law of God to excommunicate whomsoever, yea even 
kings and princes themselves." Here were the seeds sown of that controversy
which sprang up between Beza and Erastus about the matter of excommunication,
whether there ought to be in all churches an Eldership having power to
excommnuicate, and a part of that Eldership to be chosen out from amongst the
laity for that purpose. In which disputation they have, as to me it seemeth,
divided very equally the truth between them, Beza most truly maintaining the
necessity of excommunication, and Erastus as truly the non-necessity of lay
elders to be ministers thereof.

Amongst ourselves, there was in King Edward's days some question moved by reason

The present inhabitants of Geneva, I hope, would not take it in evil part, that
the faultiness of their people heretofore is by us so far forth laid open, as
their own learned guides and pastors have thought necessary to discover it unto
the world. For from their books and writings it is that I have collected this
whole narration, to the end it might appear in what sort amongst them that
discipline was planted, for which so much contention is raised amongst
ourselved. The reason which moved Calvin to be so earnest, was, as Beza himself
testifieth, "for that he saw how needful these bridles ware, to be put in the
jaws of that city." That which by wisdom he thought was requisite for that
people, was by as great wisdom compassed.

But wise men are men, and the truth is truth. That which Calvin did for
establishment of his discipline, seemeth more commendable than that he taught
for the countenancing of it established. Nature worketh in us all a love to our
own counsels. The contradition of others is a fan to inflame that love. Our love
set on fire to maintain that which once we have done, sharpeneth the wit to
dispute, to argue, and by all means to reason for it. Wherefore a marvel it were
if a man of so great capacity, with such indicement to make him desirous of all
kind of furtherances unto his cause, could espy in the whole Scripture of God
nothing which might breed at the least a probable opinion of likelihood, that 
divine authority itself is the same way somewhat inclinable. And all which the
wit even of Calvin was able from thence to draw, by sifting the very utmost
sentence and syllable, is no more than that certain speeches there are which to
him did seem to intimate that all Christian churches ought to have their
Elderships endued with power of excommunication, and a part of thoser Elderships
every where should be chosen out from amongst the laity, after that form which
himself had framed Geneva unto. But what argument are ye able to show, whereupon
it was ever proved by Calvin, that any one sentence of scripture did ever 
enforce these things, or the rest wherein your opinion concurreth with his
against the orders of your own church?

We should be injurious unto virtue itself, if we did derogate from them whom
their industry had made great. Two things of principal moment have deservedly
procured him honour throughout the world. The one his exceeding pains in
composing the Institutions of Christian Religion, the other his no less
industrious travails for exposition of the holy Scripture according unto the

Paradise Lost

Of man's first disobedience, and the fruit of that forbidden tree / Whose mortal
taste brought death unto the world, and all our woe, / with loss of Eden, till
one greater man / restore us, and regain the blissful seat. / Sing heavenly Muse,
that on the secret top / of Oreb, or of Sinai, didst inspire / that shepherd, who
first taught the chosen seed / in the beginning how Heaven and Earth rose out of
Chaos, or if Sion hill / delightst you more, or Siloa's brook that flowed / fast
by the Oracle of God, I thence / invoke thine aid to my adventurous song / that
without middle flight intents to soar / above the Aeonian mount, while it
pursues / things unattempted yet in prose or rhyme. / Oh chiefly thou O Spirit
that dost prefer / before all temples the upright heart and pure. / Instruct me,
for thou know'st, thou from the first / wast present, and with mighty wings
outspread / dove-like sat'st brooding on the vast abyss, / and made it pregnant,
what in me is dark / illumine, what is low raise and support. / That to the
height of this great argument / I may assert eternal providence, / and justify
the ways of God to man.

Say first, for Heaven hides nothing from thine view, / nor the deep tract of
hell, say first what cause / moved our grand parents in that happy state, /
favoured of heaven so highly, to fall off / from their creator, and transgress
his will / for one constraint, Lords of the world besides. / Who first seduced
them to that foul revolt? / The infernal serpent, he it was, whose guile /
stirred up with envy and revenge, deceived / the mother of mankind,

The first manner whereby nature teacheth men to judge good from evil, as well in
laws as in other things, is the force of their own discretion. 
Hereunto therefore St. Paul referreth oftentimes his speech, to be judged by
them that heard him, "I speak as to them that have understanding, judge ye what
I say." 
Again afterward, "Judge in yourselves, is it comely that a woman pray
uncovered?"
The exercise of this kind of judgment our Saviour requireth in the Jews. In them 
of Berea the Scripture commendeth it.
St. Paul's rule therefore generally is, "Let every man in his own mind be fully
persuaded by that he either alloweth or doth."

Some things are so familiar and plain, that truth from falsehood, and good from
evil, is most easily discerned in them, even by men of no deep capacity. 
And of that nature, for the most part, are things absolutely unto all men's
salvation necessary, either to be held or denied, either to be done or avoided.
For which cause St. Augustine acknowledgeth, that they are not only set down,
but also plainly set down in Scripture, so that he which heareth or readeth may
without any great difficulty understand.
Other things also there are belonging (though in a lower degree of importance)
to the offices of Christian men: which, because they are more obscure, more
intricate and hard to be judges of, therefore God hath appointed some to spend
their whole time in the study of things divine, to the end in these more
doubtful cases their understanding might be a light to direct others.
"If the understanding power or faculty of the soul be" (saith the grand
physician) "like unto bodily sight, not of equal sharpness in all, what can be
more convenient than that, even as the dark-sighted man is directed by the clear
about things visible, so likewise in matter of deeper discourse the wise in
heart do show the simple where his way lieth?"
Gregory Nazianzen, offended of the people's too great presumption in controlling
the judgment of them to whom they in such cases should have submitted their own,
seeketh by earnest entreaty to stay them in their own bounds:"Presume not ye
that are sheep to make yourselves guides to them who should guide your, neither
ye seek to overskip the fold which others about you have pitched. It sufficeth
for your part, that ye can well frame yourselves to be ordered. Take not upon
you to judge your judges, nor to make them subject to your laws who should be a
law to you. For God is not a God of sedition and confusion, but of peace and of
order.

Ye will say that if the guides of the people be blind, the common sort of men
must not close up their own eyes and be led by the conduct of such; if the
priest be "partial in the law", the flock must not depart from the ways of
sincere truth, and in simplicity yield to be followers of him for his place sake
and offices over them.

====================
His writings published after the question about that discipline was once begun 
omit not any the least occasion of extolling the use and singular necessity 
thereof.
Of what account the Master of Sentences was in the Church of Rome, the same and
more amongst the preachers of reformed churches Calvin had purchased; so that
the perfectest divines were judged they, which were skillfullest in Calvin's
writings.
His writings almost the very canon to judge both doctrine and discipline by.
French churches, both under others abroad and at home in their own country, all
cast according to that mould which Calvin had made.
The Church of Scotland in erecting the fabric of their reformation took the
selfsame pattern.
Till at length the discipline, which was at the first so weak, that without the
staff of their approbation, who were not subject unto it themselves, it had not
brought others under subjection, began now to challenge universal obedience, 
and to enter into open conflict with those very churches, which in desperate 
extremity had been relievers of it.

But wise men are men, and the truth is truth. 
That which Calvin did for establishment of his discipline, seemeth more 
commendable than that which he taught for the countenancing of it established.
Nature worketh in us all a love for our own counsels.
The contradiction of others is a fan to inflame that love.
Our love set on fire to maintain that which once we have done, sharpeneth the
wit to dispute, to argue, and by all means to reason for it.

Burke's text:
My errors, if any, are my own. My reputation alone is to answer for them.

para 2.1: my attempt
You see, sir, in the long letter that I have sent to you, that although I
do sincerely wish that France should enjoy a vivid spirit of rational liberty 
and I believe you deem to provide a permanent assembly in which such liberty may
reside, and an effective organ upon which it may act, it is my great misfortune 
to entertain certain doubts on various fundamental aspects of your recent 
actions.

my misfortune to entertain great doubts concerning several material points in
your late transactions.

para 3.1: my attempt

will approve the proceedings in France, based on your supposition of
the solemn seal of public approval from two London clubs, called respectively 
the Constitutional Society, and the Revolution Society.

It is because I do so that I think it necessary for me that there should be no
mistake.

para 4.3: my attempt
Those who treasure the memory of our Revolution and love the Constitution of
this nation, would take good care not to associate with men who proclaim in high
voice their fidelity in the Revolution and the Constitution, who frequently
depart from the true principles of both; men who take all occasions to abandon
the firm and modest spirit which produced the one and presides in the other.

Burke's text:
Those who cultivate the memory of our Revolution, and those who are attached to
the Constitution of this kingdom, will take good care how they are involved with
persons who, under the pretext of zeal towards the Revolution and Constitution,
too frequently wander from their true principles, and are ready on every
occasion to depart from the firm, but cautious and deliberate, spirit which
produced the one and which presides in the other.

para 4.4: my attempt
Before I respond the more important points in your letter, please allow
me to inform you what I am able to obtain of these two clubs which have thought
it proper to interfere officially with the affairs of France, first assure you
that I am not and have never been a member of either of those clubs.

Burke's text:
Before I proceed to answer the more material particulars in your letter, I shall

clubs which have thought proper, as bodies, to interfere in the concerns of
France, --- first assuring you that I am not, and that I have never been, a
member of either of those societies.

The first, calling itself the Constitutional Society, or the Society of
Constitutional Information, or some other similar names, exists, I beleive, for
seven or eight years now.

Burke's text:
The first, calling itself the Constitutional Society, or the Society for
Constitutional Information, or by some such title, is, I believe, of seven or

laudable nature.

Burke's text:
The institution of this society appears to be of a charitable, and so far of a
laudable nature:

Hooker's text:
The fourth degree of inducement is by fashioning the very notions and conceits
of men's minds in such sort, that when they read the scripture, they may think
that every thing soundeth towards the advancement of that discipline, and to the
utter disgrace of the contrary. Pythagoras, by bringing up his scholars in the
speculative knowledge of numbers, made their conceits therein so strong, that
when they came to the contemplation of things natural, they imagined that in
every particular thing they even beheld as it were with their eyes, how the
elements of number gave essence and being to the works of nature. A thing in
reason impossible; which notwithstanding, through their misfashioned preconceit,
appeared unto them no less certain, than if nature had written it in the very
foreheads of all the creatures of God. When they of the "Family of Love" have it
once in their heads, that Christ doth not signify any one person, but a quality
whereof many are partakers; that to be "raised" is nothing else but to be
regenerated, or endued with the said quality; and that when separation of them
which have it from them which have it not is here made, this is "judgment:" how
plainly do they imagine that the Scripture every where speaketh in the favour of
that sect? And assuredly, the very cause which maketh the simple and ignorant to
think they even see how the word of God runneth currently on your side, is, that
their minds are forestalled and their conceits perverted beforehand, by being
taught, that an "elder" doth signify a layman admitted only to the office or
rule of government in the Church; a "doctor", one which may only teach, and
neither preach nor administer the Sacraments; a "deacon", one which hath charge
of the alms-box, and of nothing else: that the "sceptre,", the "rod,", the
"throne" and "kingdom" of Christ, are a form of regiment, only by pastors,
elders, doctors, and deacons; that by mystical resemblance Mount Sion and
Jerusalem are the churches which admit, Samaria and Babylon the churches which
oppugn the said form of regiment. And in like sort they are taught to apply all
things spoken of repairing the walls and decayed parts of the city and temple of
God, by Esdras, Nehemias, and the rest; as if purposely the Holy Ghost had
herein meant to foresignify, what the authors of Admonitions to the Parliament,
of Supplications to the Council, of Petitions to her Majesty, and of such other
like writs, should either do or suffer in behalf of this their cause.



===========================
transcription from memory:
Weigh what doth move the common sort so much to favor this innovation, and it
shall soon appear unto you, that the force of particular reasons which for your
several opinions are alleged is a thing whereof the multitude never did nor
could so consider as to be therewith wholly carried; but some general
inducements are used to make saleable your discipline in gross; and when once
men have cast a fancy towards it, any slight declaration of specialties will
serve to lead forward men's inclinable and prepared minds.

The method of winning the people's affection unto a general liking of the
discipline hath been this: First, in the hearing of the multitude, the faults
especially of higher callings are ripped up with marvellous exceeding severity
and sharpness of reproof; which being oftentimes done begetteth a great good
opinion of integrity, zeal and holiness, to such constant reprovers of sin, as
by likelihood would never be so offended at that which is evil, unless
themselves were singularly good.

The next thing herein is, to impute all the faults and corruptions, wherewith
the world aboundeth, unto the kind of ecclesiastical government established.
Wherein, as before by reproving the faults they purchased unto themselves with
the multitude a name to be virtuous; so by finding out this kind of cause they
obtain to be judged wise above others; whereas unto the form even of Jewish
government, which the Lord himself (they all confess) did establish, with like
show of reason they might impute those faults which the prophets condemn in the
governors of that commonwealth; as to the English kind of regiment
ecclesiastical (whereof also God himself though in other sort is author,) the
stains and blemishes found in our state; which sprining from the root of human
frailty and corruption, not only are, but have been always more or less, yea and
(for anything we know to the contrary) will be till the world's end complained
of, what form of government soever take place.

Having gotten thus much sway in the hearts of men, a third step is to propose
their own form of church-government, as the only sovereign remedy of all evils;
and to adorn it with all the glorious titles that may be. And the nature, as of
men that have sick bodies, so likewise of the people in the crazedness of their
minds possessed with dislike and discontentment at things present, would think
than any thing (the virtue whereof they hear commended) would help them; but the
most, which they least have tried.

The fourth degree of inducement is by fashioning the very notions and conceits
of the people's minds in such sort, that when they read the scripture, they may
think that every thing soundeth towards the advancement of that discipline, and
the utter disgrace to the contrary.
Pythagoras, by bring up his scholars in the speculative knowledge of numbers,
made their conceits therein so strong, that when they came to the contemplation
of things nature, they imagined that in every thing they even beheld as it were
with their eyes, how the elements of nature gave essence and being to the works
of nature.
A thing in reason impossible, but notwithstanding, throught their misfashioned
preconceit, appeared unto them no less certain, than if nature had written it in
the foreheads of all the creatures of God.
When they which of the "Family of Love" had it in their heads, that Christ
doth not signify any one person, but a quality whereof many are partakers; that
to be "raised" is nothing else than to be regenerated, or endued with the said
quality; and when the separation of them which have it from them which have it
not is here made, this is "judgment"; how plainly do they imagine that the word
of God every where speaketh in the favour of that sect?
And assuredly, the very cause which maketh the multitude to think that they even
seed the word of God runneth currently on your side, is, that their minds are
forestalled and their conceits are perverted beforehand, by being taught, that
an "elder" doth signify a layman admitted to the office or rule of government in
the church; a "doctor", one which may only teach, and neither preach nor

The institution of this society seems to be of a charitable hence laudable
nature: it was intended for the promotion of circulation, at the expense of its
members, of many books which very few other people are at the risk of buying,
and thereforef are remaining unsold with the booksellers, at the cost of harming
an useful group of men.

The institution of this society appears to be of a charitable, and so far of a

I have often heard spoken of the light of those books which have crossed the

is said that certain liquors might improve by crossing the sea), but I have

information, speak a word of praise of that society; nor any act of this society
have been considered seriously, by anyone but its own members.

I have heard much talk about the lights which can be drawn from the books

The fourth degree inducement is by fashioning the very notions and conceits of
men's minds in such sort, that when they read the scripture, they may think that
everything soundeth in the favour of that discipline, and to the utter disgrace
of the contrary.
Pythagoras, by bringing up his scholars in the speculative knowledge of numbers,
made their conceits therein so strong, that when they came to the contemplation
of things natural, they imagined that in every particular thing they even see as
it were with their eyes, how the elements of number gave essence and being to
the works of nature.
A thing in reason impossible, but notwithstanding, through their misfashioned
preconceit, appeared unto them no less certain, than if nature had written in
the very foreheads of all the creatures of God.
When they of the "Family of Love" had it in their heads, that Christ doth not
signify any one person, but a quality whereof many are partakers; that to be
"raised" is nothing more than to be regenerated, or endued with the said
quality; that when the separation of them which have it from them which have it
not is here made, this is "judgment"; how plainly do they imagine that the word
of God speaketh in the favour of that sect?
And assuredly, the very cause which maketh the simple and ignorant to think that
they even see how the word of God runneth currently on your side, is, that their
minds are forestalled and their conceits perverted beforehand, by being taught,
that an "elder" doth signify a layman admitted to the office or rule of
government in the church; a "doctor", one which may only teach, and neither
preach nor administer the Sacrements; a "deacon", one which hath charge only of
the alms-box, and of nothing else; that the "sceptre", the "rod", the "throne"
and "kingdom" of Christ, are a form of regiment, only by pastors, elders,
doctors, and deacons; that by mystical resemblance Mount Sion and Jerusalem are
churches which admit, Samaria and Babylon the churches which oppugn the said
regiment.
And by like ... they are taught,
that purposely the Holy Ghost had meant to foresignify,
that the authors of Admonitions to the Parliament, of Supplications to the
Council, of Petitions to her Majesty, and of other such like writs, ...
to do or suffer this their cause.

Having gotten thus much sway in the minds of the people, a third step is to
propose their own form of church-government, as the only sovereign remedy to all
evils. And that nature, as of men that have sick bodies, so likewise of the
people in the crazedness of their minds possesed with dislike and discontentment
at things present, is to think that any thing (the virtue whereof they hear
commended) would help them; but the most, which they least have tried.

The next thing hereunto is, to impute all faults and corruptions, which this
world aboundeth, unto the kind of ecclesiastical regiment established. Wherein,
as before by reproving the faults they purchased unto themselves with the
multitude a name to be virtuous; so by finding out this kind of cause they
obtain to be judged wise above others; whereas unto the form even of Jewish
government, which the Lord himself (as they all confess) did establish, with
like show of reason they might impute those faults which the prophets condemn in
the governors of that commonwealth; as to the English form of regiment
ecclesiastical, (whereof also God himself though in other sort is author) the
stains and blemishes found in our state; which springing from the root of human
frailty and corruption, not only are, but have been always more or less, yea and
(for any thing we know to the contrary) will be till the world's end complained
of, what form of government soever take place.

The method of winning the people's affection unto a general liking of "the
cause" (for so ye term it) hath been this: First, in the hearing of the
multitude, the faults especially of higher callings are ripped up with
marvellous exceeding severity and sharpness of reproof; which being oftentimes
done begetteth a great good opinion of integrity, zeal, and holiness, to such
constant reprovers of sin, as by likelihood would never be so offended at that
which is evil, unless themselves were singularly good.

Weigh what doth move the common sort so much to favor this innovation, and it
shall soon appear unto you, that the force of particular reasons which for your
several opinions are alleged is a thing whereof the multitude never did nor
could so consider as to be therewith wholly carried; but certain general
inducements are used to make saleable your cause in gross; and when once men
have cast a fancy towards it, any slight declaration of specialties will serve
to lead forward men's inclinable and prepared minds.

If it be granted a thing illegal for private men, not called unto public
consultation, to dispute which is the best state of civil polity, (with a desire
of bringing in some other kind, than that under which they already live, for of
such disputes I take it his meaning was,) if it be a thing confessed, that of
such questions they cannot determine without rashness, in as much as a great
part of them consisteth of special circumstances, and for one kind as many
reasons may be brought as for another; is there any reason in the world, why
they should better judge what kind of regiment ecclesiastical is the fittest?
For in the civil state more insights, and in those affairs more experience a
great deal must needs be granted them, than in this they can possibly have. When
they which write in defence of your discipline and commend it unto the highest
not in the least cunning manner, are forced notwithstanding to acknowledge, that
"with whom the truth is they know not", they are not certain; what certainty of
knowledge can the multitude have thereof?

Some things are so familiar and plain, that truth from falsehood, and good from
evil, is most easily discerned in them, even by men of no deep capacity. And of
that nature, for the most part, are things absolutely unto all men's nature
necessary, either to be held or denied, either to be done or avoided. For which
cause St. Augustine acknowledgeth, that they are not only set down, but also
plainly set down in scripture, so that they which heareth or readeth may without
any great difficulty understand. Other thing also belonging (though in a lower
degree of importance) unto the offices of Christian men, but because they are
more obscure, more intricate and hard to be judged of, therefore God hath
appointed some to spend their whole time principally in the study of things
divine, to the end that in these more doubtful cases their understanding might
be a light to direct others. "If the understanding power or faculty be" (saith
the grand physician) "like unto bodily sight, not of equal sharpness in all,
what can be more convenient than that, even as the dark-sighted men are directed
by the clear about things visible; so likewise in matters of deeper discourse
the wise do show the simple where his way lieth?" In our more doubtful cases of
law, what man is there who seeth not how requisite it is that professors of
skill in that faculty be our directors? So it is in all other kinds of
knowledge. Gregory Nazianzen, offended at the people's too great earnestness in
controlling the judgment of them to whom in such cases they should have rather
submitted their own, seeketh by earnest entreaty to stay them within their
bounds: "Presume not ye that are sheep to make yourselves guides to them that
should guide you, neither seek ye to overskip the fold which they about you have
pitched. It sufficeth for your part, if ye can well frame yourselves to be
judged. Take not upon yourselves to judge your judges, nor to make them subject
to your laws who should be a law to you; for God is not a God of sedition and
confusion, but of order and of peace."

Review Hooker's text:
But wise men are men, and the truth is truth. That which Calvin did for
establishment of his discipline, seemeth more commendable than that which
he taught for the countenancing of it established. Nature worketh in us all a
love to our own counsels. The contradiction of others is a fan to inflame this
love. Our love set on fire to maintain that which once we have done, sharpeneth
the wit to dispute, to argue, and by all means to reason for it. Wherefore a
marvel it were if a man of so great capacity, having such incitements to make him
desirous of all kind of furtherances unto his cause, could espy in the whole
Scripture of God nothing which might at the least breed a probable opinion of
likelihood, that divine authority itself is the same way somewhat inclinable.
And all which the wit even of Calvin was able from thence to draw, by sifting
the very utmost sentence and syllable, is no more than that certain speeches
there are which to him did seem to intimate that all Christian churches ought to
have their Elderships endued with power of excommunication, and a part of those
Elderships every where should be chosen out from amongst the laity, after that
form which himself had framed Geneva unto. But what argument are ye able to
show, whereby it was ever proved by Calvin, that any one sentence of Scripture
doth necessarily enforce these things, or the rest wherein your opinion
concurreth with his against the orders of your own church.

The present inhabitants of Geneva, I hope, will not take it in evil parts, that
the faultiness of their people heretofore is by us so far forth laid open, as
their own learned guides and pastors have thought necessary to discover it unto
the world.

The next thing hereunto is, to impute all faults and corruptions, wherewith the
world aboundeth, unto the kind of ecclesiastical government esatablished.

Wherein, as before by reproving faults they purchased unto themselves with
the multitude a name to be virtuous, so by finding out this kind of cause they

Having gotten thus much sway in the hearts of men, a third step is to propose
their own form of church-government, as the only sovereign remedy of all evils;
and to adorn it with all the glorious title that may be.

And the nature, as of men that have sick bodies, so likewise of the people in
the crazedness of their minds possed with dislike and discontentment at things
present, is to imagine that any thing (the virtue whereof they hear commended)
would help them; but that most, which they least have tried.

The fourth degree of inducement is by fashioning the very notions and conceits
of men's minds in such sort, that when they read the Scripture, they may think
that every thing soundeth towards the advancement of that discipline, and to the
utter disgrace of the contrary.

Pythagoras, by bringing up his scholars in the speculative knowledge of numbers,
made their conceits therein so strong, that when they came to the contemplation
of things natural, they imagined that in every particular thing they even beheld 
as it were with their eyes, how the elements of numbers gave essence and being 
to the works of nature.

A thing in reason impossible; which notwithstanding, through their misfashioned

And in like sort they are taught to apply all things spoken of repairing the

the authors of the Admonitions to the Parliament, of the Supplications to the
Council, of the Petitions to her Majesty, and of such other like writs, should
do or suffer in behalf of this their cause.

From hence they proceed to a higher point, which is the persuading of men
credulous and over-capable of such pleasing errors, that it is the special
illumination of the Holy Ghost, whereby they discern those things in the
word, which others reading yet discern them not. "Dearly beloved", saith St.
John, "give not credit unto every spirit."

There are but two ways whereby the Spirit leadeth men to all truth; the one
extraordinary, the other common; the one belonging but unto some few, the other
extending itself unto all that are of God; the one, that which we call by a
special divine excellency Revelation, the other Reason.

Amongst ourselves, there was in King Edward's days some question moved by reason
of a few men's scrupulosity touching certain things.

And beyond seas, of them which fled in the days of Queen Mary, some contenting
themselves abroad with the use of their own service-book at home authorized
before their departure out of the realm, others liking better the Common
Prayer-book of the Church of Geneva translated, those smaller contentions before
begun were by this mean somewhat increased.

Under the happy reign of her Majesty which now is, the greatest matter a while
contended for was the wearing of the cap and surplice, till there came
Admonitions directed unto the high court of Parliament, by men who
concealing their names thought it glory enough to discover their minds and
affections, which now were universally bent even against all the orders and
laws, wherein this church is found unconformable to the platform of Geneva.

Concerning the defender of which Admonitions, all that I mean to say is but this:
there will come a time when three words uttered with charity and meekness shall
receive a far more blessed reward than three thousand words written with
disdainful sharpness of wit.

But the manner of men's writing must not alienate our hearts from the truth, if
it appear they have the truth; as the followers of the same
defender do think he hath; and in that persuasion they follow him, no otherwise
than himself doth Calvin, Beza, and others, with the like persuasion that they
in this cause had the truth.

We being as fully persuaded otherwise, it resteth that some kind of trial be 
used to find out which part is in error.

To one of those churches which lived in most peaceable sort, and abounded as
well with men for their learning in other professions singular, as also with 
divines whose equals were not elsewhere to be found, a church ordered by 
Gualter's discipline, and not by that which Geneva adoreth; 
unto this church, the Church of Heidelberg, there cometh one who craving leave 
to dispute publickly defendeth with open
disdain of their government, that "to a minister with his eldership power is
given by the law of God to excommunicated whomsoever, yea even kings and princes
themselves."

Here were the seed sown of that controversy which sprang up between Beza and 
Erastus about the matter of excommuncation, whether there ought to be in all
churches an eldership having power to excommunicate, and a part of that
eldership to be of necessity certain chosen out from amongst the laity for
that purpose.

In which disputation they have, as to me it seemeth, divided very equally the
truth between them; Beza most truly maintaining the necessity of
excommunication, Erastus as truly the non-necessity of lay elders to be
ministers thereof.


===================
Hooker's text:

Most sure it is, that when men's affections do frame their opinions, they are in
defence of error more earnest a great deal, than (for the most part) sound
believers in the maintenance of truth apprehended according to the nature of
that evidence which scripture yieldth: which being in some things plain, as in
the principles of Christian doctrine; in some things, as in these matters of
discipline, more dark and doubtful; frameth correspondently that inward assent
which God's most gracious Spirit worketh by it as by his effectural instrument.

Most sure it is, that when ... do frame ..., they are in defence of ... 
more ..., than ... in the maintenance of ... apprehended according to ... 
which ... yieldeth: which being in some things ..., as in ...; 
in some things, as in ..., more ...;

Hooker: text review

We should be injurious unto virtue itself, if we should derogate from them whom
their industry hath made great.

Two things of principal moment there are which have deservedly procured him
honour throughout the world: the one his exceeding pains in composing the
Institutions of Christian Religion; the other his no less industrious travails
for exposition of holy Scripture according unto the same Institutions.

In which two things whosoever they were that after him bestowed their labour, 
he gained advantages of prejudice against them, if they gainsayed; and of glory 
above them, if they consented.

His writings published after the question about that discipline was once begun
omit not any the least occasion of extolling the use and singular necessity 
thereof.

Of what account the Master of Sentences was in the Church of Rome, the same and
more amongst the preachers of reformed churches Calvin had purchased; so that
the perfectest divines were judged they, which were skilfullest in Calvin's
writings. His books almost the very canon to judge both doctrine and discipline
by.

French churches, both under others abroad and at home in their own country, all
cast according to that mould which Calvin had made.
The Church of Scotland in erecting the fabric of their reformation took the
selfsame pattern.

Till at length the discipline, which was at the first so weak, that without the
staff of their approbation, who were not subject unto it themselves, it had
not brought others under subjection, began now to challenge universal obedience, and
to enter into open conflict with those very churches, which in desperate
extremity had been relievers of it.
