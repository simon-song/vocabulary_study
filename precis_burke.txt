In Chap. 5, p. 117, the authors quote (without giving any source) Lord Macaulay 
as saying:

  At the foot of every page I read I stopped and obliged myself to give an 
  account of what I had read on that page. At first I had to read it three 
  or four times before I got my mind firmly fixed. But I compelled myself 
  to comply with the plan, until now, after I have read a book through once, 
  I can almost recite it from the beginning to the end.

Dear Sir, --- You sent me a second letter asking for my thoughts on the 
lastest proceedings in France. The first letter I wrote for
you and for you only, so shall I be in this one.

[Alternative]: You sent me a second letter asking for my thoughts on the latest
proceedings in France. I do not think my opionions to be so valuable to be made
public, and I am writing this second letter (just like the first one) for your
eyes only.

Although I wish that France may enjoy a rational liberty, yet I have some doubts
concerning several things of the latest transactions in France.

===============================

===============================
You imagined that I would heartily approve the latest events in France,
because it had received sanctions from two London clubs: the Constitutional 
Society and the Revolution Society.

================
p. [2] para. 2:
(1) I belong to several clubs which hold the Constitution and the principles of
    the Glorious Revolution in high reverence.
(2) I count myself as most zealous for maintaining those things in their purity
    and vigor. 
(3) Because of (1) and (2), there should be no mistake [of what?].
(4) We should take good care to separate us from those distractors of the
    constitutional principles.
(5) I will give you an overview of the two societies [which fit in (4)].
(6) I am not, and have never been, a member of either of those societies.

===============================

I had the honour to belong to several clubs which treasure our Constitution and
the principles of the Glorious Revolution (in 1688), but I am not, and have
never been, a member of either of the afore said societies. Before I proceed to
other things, let me first give you some information about these two clubs.

================
p. [3] para. 1:
(1) The first club is called the Constitutional Society, or Society for
    Constitutional Information, has existed for seven or eight years.
(2) The main purpose of the club is to circulate books which are not very
    desirable out of the club.
(3) Some of those books may have been exported to France and made some impact
    there.
(4) But I have never heard any praise on either the publications or the 
    proceedings of this club.

OED I.1: The quality of being equal or fair; fairness, impartiality; evenhanded
dealing.

(1) The National Assembly (of France) has reserved their attention to the second
    club: the Revolution Society.
(2) The Constitutional Society deserves some credit from the National Assembly.
(3) This club was adopted by the National Assemby, and they returned the favor
    by acting as a committe in England for extending the principles of the
    National Assembly.
(4) This revolution has given splendor to obscurity and distinction to
    undiscerned merit.
(5) The Revolution Society is little known before this.
(6) The members of this club gathered every year at the anniversarity of the
    Glorious Revolution, heard a sermon, then spent the rest of the day in the
    tavern.
(7) I never heard any public measure or political system discussed by this club.
(8) I was shocked to hear the authorative sanction from this club to the
    proceedings of the National Assembly in France.

management:
OED 2.a. The use of contrivance, prudence, or ingenuity for effecting some
purpose; often in unfavourable sense, implying deceit or trickery.

(1) I do not object the ancient principles and conduct of the club.
(2) It is probable that some new members have joined the club for some purpose; 
    and some Christian politicians may have with contrivance used these 
    principles for their own purposes.
(3) Though I suspect that there is much private manoeuvre, I will only speak
    about public issues of this club.

I have no problem with the ancient principles of the club. It is probable some
new members were used by certain Christian politicians to advance their own
agenda. In spite of this, I will from now on only speak of the public dealings
of the club.

with; to have to do with; to have a part or share in; to be engaged in, with.

(1) I should be sorry to be connected to this club.

validity.

(1) I should be more unwilling to enter into a correspondence which would trick
    others to think that it is from an official source.
(2) The house of commons would reject all kinds of ambiguous petitions which 
    your National Assembly had accepted from this society.
(3) If what the society sent out had been a piece of argument, it does not
    matter who wrote it.
(4) The declaration from this society is done by vote and resolution, and bears
    few signatures.
(5) Their signatures ought to be annexed to their document, so that we can know
    their identity, social status, experience, and authority.
(6) To me, the proceeding looks like a political stratagem to give their public
    declaration an importance they did not deserve.

I should be more unwilling to enter into a correspondence under an equivocal
description which might trick others to think that it comes from an official
source. This kind of petitions will be firmly rejected by the House of
Commons, but in this case it had been accepted with open arms by your National
Assembly. Since the declaration from this society is done by vote and 
resolution, the signatures of all their participants should be annexed, so that 
we can decide whether they possess such an authority. To me, the proceeding
looks like a political stratagem to give their public declaration an undeserved
importance.

Considerations before making judgment on liberty:

    government, with public force, with the discipline and obedience of armies,
    with the collection of an effective and well-distributed revenue, with
    morality and religion, ...
(3) Liberty for an individual means to do whatsoever he wants, but liberty for
    men act in bodies means power.

    England, and advocating in England to imitate the conduct of the National

==  precis of p. [12] para. 2:
================================
On November 4th last year, Dr. Richard Price, a famous non-conforming minister, 
preached a miscellaneous sermon, whereof the central topic was the Revolution in
France. This I believe was the origin of the resolution of the Revolution
Society transmitted to the National Assembly of France.

preached in those new churches.
(4) It is unlikely such a system will produce any religion rational and manly.

This doctrine, as applied to the present king of Britain, is either nonsense, or

propogate his doctrine without people noticing this contradiction.

nugatory:
OED 1. Trifling, of no value or importance, worthless.

(1) Dr. Price and his people may argue that some of the king's predecessors have
been called to the throne by some sort of choice, thus he owes his crown to the
choice of the people.
(2) This interpretation of the idea of election is not very different from our 
idea of inheritance.
(3) At some time or other, all the beginners of dynasties were chosen by those
who called them to govern, thus elective.
(4) Despite of whatsoever origin, the king of Britain today is chosen by a fixed
rule of succession, according to the laws.

Surely, at some time, all the founders of dynasties were chosen by those who
