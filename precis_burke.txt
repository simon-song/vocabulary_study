Pauk & Owens, How to Study in College, 10ed.

In Chap. 5, p. 117, the authors quote (without giving any source) Lord Macaulay 
as saying:

  At the foot of every page I read I stopped and obliged myself to give an 
  account of what I had read on that page. At first I had to read it three 
  or four times before I got my mind firmly fixed. But I compelled myself 
  to comply with the plan, until now, after I have read a book through once, 
  I can almost recite it from the beginning to the end.

===============================
Dear Sir, --- You sent me a second letter asking for my thoughts on the 
lastest proceedings in France. The first letter I wrote for
you and for you only, so shall I be in this one.

[Alternative]: You sent me a second letter asking for my thoughts on the latest
proceedings in France. I do not think my opionions to be so valuable to be made
public, and I am writing this second letter (just like the first one) for your
eyes only.

===============================
Although I wish that France may enjoy a rational liberty, yet I have some doubts
concerning several things of the latest transactions in France.

===============================

===============================
You imagined that I would heartily approve the latest events in France,
because it had received sanctions from two London clubs: the Constitutional 
Society and the Revolution Society.

================
p. [2] para. 2:
(1) I belong to several clubs which hold the Constitution and the principles of
    the Glorious Revolution in high reverence.
(2) I count myself as most zealous for maintaining those things in their purity
    and vigor. 
(3) Because of (1) and (2), there should be no mistake [of what?].
(4) We should take good care to separate us from those distractors of the
    constitutional principles.
(5) I will give you an overview of the two societies [which fit in (4)].
(6) I am not, and have never been, a member of either of those societies.

I had the honour to belong to several clubs which treasures our Constitution and
the principles of the Glorious Revolution (in 1688), but I am not, and have
never been, a member of either of the afore said societies. Before I proceed to
other things, let me first give you some information about these two clubs.

================
p. [3] para. 1:
(1) The first club is called the Constitutional Society, or Society for
    Constitutional Information, has existed for seven or eight years.
(2) The main purpose of the club is to circulate books which are not very
    desirable out of the club.
(3) Some of those books may have been exported to France and made some impact
    there.
(4) But I have never heard any praise on either the publications or the 
    proceedings of this club.

(1) The National Assembly (of France) has reserved their attention to the second
    club: the Revolution Society.
(2) Some members of the Revolution Society also belong to the Constitutional
    Society.
(3) This club was adopted by the National Assemby, and they returned the favor
    by acting as a committe in England for extending the principles of the
    National Assembly.
(4) This revolution has given splendor to obscurity and distinction to
    undiscerned merit.
(5) The Revolution Society is little known before this.
(6) The members of this club gathered every year at the anniversarity of the
    Glorious Revolution, heard a sermon, then spent the rest of the day in the
    tavern.
(7) I never heard any public measure or political system discussed by this club.
(8) I was shocked to hear the authorative sanction from this club to the
    proceedings of the National Assembly in France.

take exception: 
OED 7.c., to make (an) objection, to object or complain (that).

management:
OED 2.a. The use of contrivance, prudence, or ingenuity for effecting some
purpose; often in unfavourable sense, implying deceit or trickery.

(1) I do not object the ancient principles and conduct of the club.
(2) It is probable that some new members have joined the club for some purpose; 
    and some Christian politians may have with contrivance used these 
    principles for their own purposes.
(3) Though I suspect that there is much private manoeuvre, I will only speak
    about public issues.

with; to have to do with; to have a part or share in; to be engaged in, with.
