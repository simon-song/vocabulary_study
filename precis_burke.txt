Pauk & Owens, How to Study in College, 10ed.

In Chap. 5, p. 117, the authors quote (without giving any source) Lord Macaulay 
as saying:

  At the foot of every page I read I stopped and obliged myself to give an 
  account of what I had read on that page. At first I had to read it three 
  or four times before I got my mind firmly fixed. But I compelled myself 
  to comply with the plan, until now, after I have read a book through once, 
  I can almost recite it from the beginning to the end.

===============================
Dear Sir, --- You sent me a second letter asking for my thoughts on the 
lastest proceedings in France. The first letter I wrote for
you and for you only, so shall I be in this one.

[Alternative]: You sent me a second letter asking for my thoughts on the latest
proceedings in France. I do not think my opionions to be so valuable to be made
public, and I am writing this second letter (just like the first one) for your
eyes only.

Although I wish that France may enjoy a rational liberty, yet I have some doubts
concerning several things of the latest transactions in France.

===============================
==  precis of p. [2] para. 1:
===============================
You imagined that I would heartily approve the latest events in France,
because it had received sanctions from two London clubs: the Constitutional 
Society and the Revolution Society.

================
p. [2] para. 2:
(1) I belong to several clubs which hold the Constitution and the principles of
    the Glorious Revolution in high reverence.
(2) I count myself as most zealous for maintaining those things in their purity
    and vigor. 
(3) Because of (1) and (2), there should be no mistake [of what?].
(4) We should take good care to separate us from those distractors of the
    constitutional principles.
(5) I will give you an overview of the two societies [which fit in (4)].
(6) I am not, and have never been, a member of either of those societies.

I had the honour to belong to several clubs which treasures our Constitution and
the principles of the Glorious Revolution (in 1688), but I am not, and have
never been, a member of either of the afore said societies. Before I proceed to
other things, let me first give you some information about these two clubs.

================
p. [3] para. 1:
(1) The first club is called the Constitutional Society, or Society for
    Constitutional Information, has existed for seven or eight years.
(2) The main purpose of the club is to circulate books which are not very
    desirable out of the club.
(3) Some of those books may have been exported to France and made some impact
    there.
(4) But I have never heard any praise on either the publications or the 
    proceedings of this club.

p. [4] para. 1:
(1) The National Assembly (of France) has reserved their attention to the second
    club: the Revolution Society.
(2) Some members of the Revolution Society also belong to the Constitutional
    Society.
(3) This club was adopted by the National Assemby, and they returned the favor
    by acting as a committe in England for extending the principles of the
    National Assembly.
(4) This revolution has given splendor to obscurity and distinction to
    undiscerned merit.
(5) The Revolution Society is little known before this.
(6) The members of this club gathered every year at the anniversarity of the
    Glorious Revolution, heard a sermon, then spent the rest of the day in the
    tavern.
(7) I never heard any public measure or political system discussed by this club.
(8) I was shocked to hear the authorative sanction from this club to the
    proceedings of the National Assembly in France.

management:
OED 2.a. The use of contrivance, prudence, or ingenuity for effecting some
purpose; often in unfavourable sense, implying deceit or trickery.

(1) I do not object the ancient principles and conduct of the club.
(2) It is probable that some new members have joined the club for some purpose; 
    and some Christian politians may have with contrivance used these 
    principles for their own purposes.
(3) Though I suspect that there is much private manoeuvre, I will only speak
    about public issues of this club.

================================

This strange proceeding may be done by members who joined the club to advance
their own purposes. In spite of this, I will from now on only talk about public
issues of the club.

OED III.11a. (of word "concern"), To be in a relation or practical connection
with; to have to do with; to have a part or share in; to be engaged in, with.

(1) I should be sorry to be connected to this club.
(2) I have speculated public policies of ancient and modern nations in private.

    with a foreign government.

appropriate or plausible; capable of double interpretation; ambiguous.

or a fact recorded; a formal writing of any kind, as an agreement, deed,
charter, or record, drawn up and executed in technical form, so a to be of legal
validity.

(1) I should be more unwilling to enter into correspondence which would trick
    others to think that it is from an official source.
(2) The house of commons would reject all kinds of ambiguous petitions which 
    your National Assembly had accepted from this society.
(3) If what the society sent out had been a piece of argument, it does not
    matter who wrote it.
(4) The declaration from this society is done by vote and resolution, and bears
    few signatures.
(5) Their signatures ought to be annexed to their document, so that we can know
    their identity, social status, experience, and authority.
(6) To me, the proceeding looks like a political stratagem to give their public
    declaration an importance they did not deserve.

================================

I should be more unwilling to enter into correspondence under an equivocal
description. This kind of petitions will be firmly rejected by the House of
Commons, but in this case it had been accepted with open arms by your National
Assembly. Since the declaration from this society is done by vote and 
resolution, the signatures of all their participants should be annexed, so that 
we can decide whether they possess such an authority. To me, the proceeding
looks like a political stratagem to give their public decaration an undeserved
importance.

(1) I love a manly, moral, regulated liberty.
(2) However I do not envy the liberty in other nations.

    distinguishing color and discriminating effect.

================
p. [8] para. 1:

Considerations before making judgment on liberty:

(1) We should not make our judgment till we see somewhat more clearly how 
    things would ensue.
(2) The liberty of France will not be secure till it is combined with
    government, with public force, with the discipline and obedience of armies,
    with the collection of an effective and well-distributed revenue, with
    morality and religion, ...
(3) Liberty for an individual means to do whatsoever he wants, but liberty for
    men act in bodies means power.
(4) Considerate people would not declare liberty until they see clearly the
    principles, tempers, and dispositions of the (new) people in (new) power.

We should not rush our judgment till we see somewhat more clearly what would
ensue. Thus I would not congratulate France on her liberty till it is combined
with government, with public force, and other good things. Liberty for an
individual means to do whatsoever he wants, but liberty for men acting in bodies
means power. Thus considerate people would not declare liberty till they see
clearly the principles, tempers, and dispositions of the new people in new
power.

================
p. [10] para. 1:

(1) I got the publication of the Revolution Society with Dr. Price's sermon and
    several other documents annexed.
(2) Their writings, trying to connect the affairs of France with that of
    England, and advocating in England to imitate the conduct of the National
    Assemby, make me quite uneasy.
(3) Time is ripe for me to express my thoughts on the French Revolution.

================
p. [11] para. 1:

(1) I would like to communicate my thoughts to a larger audience.
(2) I will continue using the epistolary form and will pay little attention to
    formal method.
(3) The French Revolution is the most astonishing event in the world.
(4) It is a monstrous tragi-comedy.

================
p. [12] para. 1:

Some other people treated the French Revolution with exultation and rapture.

================

The resolution of the Revolution Society to the National Assembly originated
from a sermon by Dr. Richard Price given on Nov. 4th last year.

p. [13] para. 2:

(1) Dr. Price's sermon was in a pulpit style no longer used and showed little 
    moderation.
(2) A church is not the place for preaching political agenda.

Burke, Thoughts on the Cause of the Present Discontents

para. 1:
>> It is an undertaking of some degree of delicacy to examine into the cause of
   public disorders.
  >> If a man happens not to succeed in such an inquiry, he will be thought weak
     and visionary;
  >> If he touches the true grievance, there is a danger that he may come near 
     to persons of weight and consequence,
       >> who will rather be exasperated at the discovery of their errors,
          than thankful for the occasion of correcting them;
  >> If he should be obliged to blame the favorites of the people, he will be
     considered as the tool of the power;
  >> If he censures those in power, he will be looked on as an instrument of the
     faction.
>> But in all exertions of duty something is to be hazarded.
  >> In case of tumult and disorder, our law has invested every man, in some
     sort, with the authority of a magistrate.
  >> When the affairs of the nation are distracted, private people are, 
         by the spirit of that law, 
     justified in stepping a little out of their ordinary sphere.
  >> They enjoy a privilege, of somewhat more dignity and effect, than that of 
     idle lamentation over the calamities of their country.
  >> They may look into them narrowly; 
     they may reason upon them liberally; 
     and if they should be so fortunate as to discover the true source of the
     mischief, 
     and to suggest any probable method of removing it, 
         though they may displease the rulers of the day, 
     they are certainly of service to the cause of the government.
  >> Government is deeply interest in everything which,
         even through the medium of some temporary uneasiness,
     may tend finally to compose the minds of the subject,
     and to conciliate their affections.
>> I have nothing to do here with the abstract value of the voice of the people.
>> But as long as reputation,
       the most precious possession of every individual,
   and as long as opinion,
       the great support of the state,
   depend entirely upon the voice, 
   it can never be considered as a thing of little consequence either to
   individuals or to governments.
>> Nations are not primarily ruled by laws: less by violence.
>> Whatever original energy may be supposed either in force or regulation, 
   the operation of both is,
       in truth,
   merely instrumental.
>> Nations are governed by the same methods, and on the same principles, by
   which an individual without authority is often able to govern those who are
   his equals or his superiors; 
       by a knowledge of their temper, 
       and by a judicious management of it;
   I mean, --- when public affairs are steadily and quietly conducted;
   not when government is nothing but a continued scuffle between the magistrate
   and the multitude;
       in which sometimes the one and some times the other is uppermost;
       in which they alternately yield and prevail;
       in a series of contemptible victories, and scandalous submissions.
>> The temper of the people 
       amongst whom he presides
   ought therefore to be the first study of a statesman.
>> And the knowledge of this temper it is by no means impossible for him to
   attain, 
       if he has not an interest in being ignorant of what is his duty to learn.
   
para. 2:
>> To complain of the age we live in,
   to murmur at the present possessors of power,
   to lament the past,
   to conceive extravagant hopes of the future, 
       are the common dispositions of the greatest part of mankind;
       indeed the necessary effects of the ignorance and levity of the vulgar.
>> Such complaints and humors have existed in all times;
   yet as all times have not been alike,
   true political sagacity manifests itself in distinguishing that complaint
       which only characterizes the general infirmity of human nature,
   from those 
       which are symptoms of the particular distemperature of our own air and 
       season.

para. 3:
>> Nobody,
       I believe,
   will consider it merely as the language of spleen or disappointment,
   if I say,
       that there is something particularly alarming in the present conjuncture.
>> There is hardly a man,
       in or out of power,
   who holds any other language.
>> That government is at once dreaded and contemned;
   that the laws are despoiled of all their respected and salutary terrors;
   that their inaction is a subject of ridicule, 
       and their exertion of adhorrence;
   that rank, and office and title, and all the solemn plausibilities of the
       world, have lost their reverence and effect;
   that our foreign politics are as much deranged as our domestic economy;
   that our dependencies are slackened in their affection, and loosened from
       their obedience;
   that we know neither how to yield nor how to enforce;
   that hardly anything above or below, abroad or at home, is sound and entire;
   but that disconnection and confusion, in offices, in parties, in families,
       in Parliament, in the nation, prevail beyond the disorders of any former
       time:
   these are facts universally admitted and lamented.
   
para. 4:
>> This state of things is the more extraordinary,
   because the great parties 
       which formerly divided and agitated the kingdom 
   are known to be in a manner entirely dissolved.
>> No great external calamity has visited the nation;
   no pestilence or famine.
>> We do not labor at present under any scheme of taxation new or oppressive in
   the quantity or in the mode.
>> Nor are we engaged in unsuccessful war; 
   in which, 
       our misfortunes might easily pervert our judgment;
   and our minds, 
       sore from the loss of national glory,
   might feel every blow of fortune as a crime in government.

para. 5:
>> It is impossible that the cause of this strange distemper should not
   sometimes become a subject of discourse.
>> It is a compliment due,
      and which I willingly pay,
   to those who administer our affairs,
      to take notice in the first place of their speculation.
>> Our ministers are of opinion, 
       that the increase of our trade and manufactures,
       that our growth by colonization, and by conquest,
           have concurred to accumulate immense wealth in the hands of some
           individuals;
       and this again 
           being dispersed among the people,
       has rendered them universally proud, ferocious, and ungovernable;
       that the insolence of some from their enormous wealth,
       and the boldness of others from a guilty poverty,
           have rendered them capable of the most atrocious attempts;
       so that they have trampled upon all subordination,
       and violently borne down the unarmed laws of a free government;
       barriers too feeble against the fury of a populace so fierce and
       licentious as ours.
