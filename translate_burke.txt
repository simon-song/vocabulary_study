Scritti Politici di Edmund Burke, a cura di Anna Martelloni, p.152

para 1.1: my attempt
Sir, you are pleased to call again, and with some earnestness, for my opinions
on the latest proceedings in France.

Burke's text:
Dear Sir, You are pleased to call again, and with some earnestness, for my
thoughts on the late proceedings in France.

para 1.2: my attempts
I will not give you reason to suppose that I would attribute/bestow/confer
such value to my opinions to wish to be repeatedly solicited to express them.
I will not give you reason to think that I assign such value to my opinions as
to wish to be solicited about them.

Burke's text:
I will not give you reason to imagine that I think my sentiments of such value
as to wish myself to be solicited about them.

para 1.3: my attempt
They are of too little importance to be very anxiously either communicated
or withheld.

Burke's text:
They are of too little consequence to be very anxiously either communicated or
withheld.

para 1.4: my attempt
It was only from attention to you that I hesitated the first time you asked me.

Burke's text:
It was from attention to you, and to you only, that I hesitated at the time when
you first desired to receive them.

para 1.5: my attempt
In the first letter that I had the honor to write you, and at length I sent, I
wrote neither for or by the account of others; nor shall I in this one.

Burke's text:
In the first letter I had the honor to write to you, and which at length I send,
I wrote neither for nor from any description of men; nor shall I in this.

para 1.6: my attempt
My errors, if any, are my own, and my reputation only is responsible for them. 

Burke's text:
My errors, if any, are my own. My reputation alone is to answer for them.

para 2.1: my attempt
You see, sir, in the long letter that I have sent to you, that although I
do sincerely wish that France should enjoy a vivid spirit of rational liberty 
and I believe you deem to provide a permanent assembly in which such liberty may
reside, and an effective organ upon which it may act, it is my great misfortune 
to entertain certain doubts on various fundamental aspects of your recent 
actions.

Burke's text:
You see, Sir, by the long letter I have transmitted to you, that, though I do
most heartily wish that France may be animated by a spirit of rational liberty,
and that I think you bound, in all honest policy, to provide a permanent body in
which that spirit may reside, and an effectual organ by which it may act, it is
my misfortune to entertain great doubts concerning several material points in
your late transactions.

para 3.1: my attempt
You imagined, when you wrote last, that I might be counted among those who
will approve the proceedings in France, based on your supposition of
the solemn seal of public approval from two London clubs, called respectively 
the Constitutional Society, and the Revolution Society.

Burke's text:
You imagine, when you wrote last, that I might possibly be reckoned among the
approvers of certain proceedings in France, from the solemn public seal of
sanction they have received from two clubs of gentlemen in London, called the
Constitutional Society, and the Revolution Society.

para 4.1: my attempt
I certainly have the honor to belong to more clubs than one in which the
constitution of this kingdom and the principles of our glorious Revolution are
held in high reverence; and I consider myself among the most enthusiastic
to defend this constitution and those principles in their uttermost purity and
vigor.

Burke's text:
I certainly have the honor to belong to more clubs than one in which the
Constitution of this kingdom and the principles of the glorious Revolution are
held in high reverence; and I reckon myself among the most forward in my zeal
for maintaining that Constitution and those principles in their utmost purity
and vigor.

para 4.2: my attempt
It is because I do so, that I think there should be no mistake.

Burke's text:
It is because I do so that I think it necessary for me that there should be no
mistake.

para 4.3: my attempt
Those who treasure the memory of our Revolution and love the Constitution of
this nation, would take good care not to associate with men who proclaim in high
voice their fidelity in the Revolution and the Constitution, who frequently
depart from the true principles of both; men who take all occasions to abandon
the firm and modest spirit which produced the one and presides in the other.

Burke's text:
Those who cultivate the memory of our Revolution, and those who are attached to
the Constitution of this kingdom, will take good care how they are involved with
persons who, under the pretext of zeal towards the Revolution and Constitution,
too frequently wander from their true principles, and are ready on every
occasion to depart from the firm, but cautious and deliberate, spirit which
produced the one and which presides in the other.

para 4.4: my attempt
Before I respond the more important points in your letter, please allow
me to inform you what I am able to obtain of these two clubs which have thought
it proper to interfere officially with the affairs of France, first assure you
that I am not and have never been a member of either of those clubs.

Burke's text:
Before I proceed to answer the more material particulars in your letter, I shall
beg leave to give you such information as I have been able to obtain of the two
clubs which have thought proper, as bodies, to interfere in the concerns of
France, --- first assuring you that I am not, and that I have never been, a
member of either of those societies.

para 5.1: my attempt
The first, calling itself the Constitutional Society, or the Society of
Constitutional Information, or some other similar names, exists, I beleive, for
seven or eight years now.

Burke's text:
The first, calling itself the Constitutional Society, or the Society for
Constitutional Information, or by some such title, is, I believe, of seven or
eight years standing.

para 5.2: my attempt
The institution of this association appears to be of a charitable therefore
laudable nature.

Burke's text:
The institution of this society appears to be of a charitable, and so far of a
laudable nature:

para 5.3: my attempt
It was established to promote the circulation, at the expense of its members, of
the books which very few people would otherwise purchase,

Burke, Italiano->English
 
1st attempt:
Before I start to answer some of the more material points in your letter, first
allow me to take leave to inform you what I have managed to learn about these 
two clubs which have thought proper, in their pretended capacity of corporation,
to be officially involved in the affairs of France: First assure you, that I am 
not, and have never been a member of either of these clubs.

2nd attempt:
Before I proceed to answer the more material particulars in your letter, I shall
beg leave to give you information which I have managed to obtain on these two
clubs which have thought proper, as bodies, to interfere officially the affairs
of France: first assuring you that I am not, and have never been a member of
either of these clubs. 

3rd attempt: 
Before I proceed to answer the more material particulars in your letter, I shall
beg leave to give you information which I am able to obtain of these two clubs

those societies.

4th attempt:

France: first assuring you, that I am not, and that I have never been, a member

=============
1st attempt:
The first, calling itself the Constitutional Society, or the Society of
Constitutional Information, or of[?] some other similar title, is, I believe, of
seven or eight years standing.

2nd attempt:
The first, calling itself the Constitutional Society, or the Society for
Constitutional Information, or some other like title, is, I believe, of seven or
eight years' standing.

3rd attempt:
The first, calling itself the Constitutional Society, or the Society for
Constitutional Information, or by some such title, is, I believe, of seven or
eight years' standing.

=============
1st attempt:
The institution of this society seems to be of a charitable hence laudable
nature: it was intended for the promotion of circulation, at the expense of its
members, of many books which very few other people are at the risk of buying,
and thereforef are remaining unsold with the booksellers, at the cost of harming
an useful group of men.

2nd attempt:
The institution of this society appears to be of a charitable, and so far of a
laudable nature: it was intended for the circulation, at the expense of the
members, of many books which few others are at the expense of buying, and which
might lie at the hands of the booksellers, to the great loss of an useful
group of men.

body of men.

=============
1st attempt:
Whether the books so charitably circulated were as charitably read, is more than
I know.

2nd attempt:
Whether the books so charitably circulated were as ever charitably read is more
than I know.

=============
1st attempt:
Probably some of them have been exported to France where they, like goods not 
needed here, have found a favorable market.

2nd attempt:
Possible several of them have been exported to France, and, like goods not in
request here, may with you have found a favorable market.

=============
1st attempt:
I have often heard spoken of the light of those books which have crossed the
shores; I do not know what improvement might arise during their cross (like it
is said that certain liquors might improve by crossing the sea), but I have
never heard a person equipped with common good sense, or at the least a little
information, speak a word of praise of that society; nor any act of this society
have been considered seriously, by anyone but its own members.

2nd attempt:
I have heard much talk about the lights which can be drawn from the books 
send from hence. What improvements they might be able to get (as it is said 
that certain liquors are meliorated by crossing the sea) I cannot tell; but I
have never heard any man ...

1st attempt:
I have heard much talk about the light from books sent to such expedition.

2nd attempt:
I have heard much talk of the lights which could be drawn from the books sent
from hence.

3rd attempt:
I have heard much talk of the lights to be drawn from books that are sent from
hence.

1st attempt:
What improvement they could get during the crossing (as some say that 
certain liquors would meliorate by crossing the sea) I cannot tell, but I have
never heard any man equipped with a common good sense, or the least information, 
speaks a word in favor of the majority part of those publications circulated by
that society; nor was any document of this society been considered seriously,
except by its own members.

2nd attempt:
What improvements they have had in their passage (as it is said that certain
liquors are meliorated by crossing the sea) I cannot tell; but I never heard a
man with common judgment, or the least degree of information, speak a word of
praise on the greater part of the publications circulated by that society, nor
has any of their books received, except from its own members, any serious 
consideration.

3rd attempt:
What improvements they have had in their passage (as it is said that some
liquors are meliorated by crossing the sea) I cannot tell; but I never heard a
man of common judgment or the least degree of information speak a word in praise
of the greater part of the publications circulated by that society; nor have
their proceedings been taken, except by some of their own, to be of any serious
consquence.

4th attempt:
What improvements they have had in their passage (as it is said that some
liquors are meliorated by crossing the sea) I cannot tell; but I never heard a
man of common judgment or the least degree of information speak a word in praise
of the greater part of the publications circulated by that society; nor have
their proceedings been accounted, except by some of themselves, as of any
serious consequence.
