Sentence analysis using Cicero, Pro Milone, tr. by C.D. Yonge (1891)
cf. Fotheringham, Persuasive Language in Cicero's Pro Milone

>> Although I am afraid, O judges, 
       that it is a base thing 
           for one who is beginning to speak for a very brave man to be alarmed, 
       and though it is far from becoming, 
               when Titus Annius Milo himself is more disturbed for the safety 
               of the republic than for his own, 
           that I should not be able to bring to the cause a similar greatness 
           of mind, 
   yet this novel appearance of a new manner of trial alarms my eyes, 
       which, 
           wherever they fall, 
       seek for the former customs of the forum and the ancient practice in 
       trials. 

>> For your assembly is not surrounded by a circle of bystanders 
       as usual; 
   we are not attended by our usual company;
   For those guards 
       which you behold in front of all the temples, 
       although they are placed there as a protection against violence, 
   yet they bring no aid to the orator, 
       so that even in the forum and in the court of justice itself, 
           although we are protected with all military and necessary defences, 
       yet we cannot be entirely without fear. 

>> But if I thought 
       this adverse to Milo, 
   I should yield to the times, O judges, 
   and among such a crowd of armed men, I should think 
       there was no room for an orator. 

>> But the wisdom of Cnaeus Pompeius, 
       a most wise and just man, 
   strengthens and encourages me, 
       who would certainly neither think 
           it suitable to his justice 
               to deliver that man up to the weapons of the soldiery
                   whom he had given over as an accused person to the decision 
                   of the judges, 
           nor suitable to his wisdom 
               to arm the rashness of an excited multitude with public authority.
