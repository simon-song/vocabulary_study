======================================================================

>> Although I am afraid, O judges, 
       that it is a base thing 
           for one who is beginning to speak for a very brave man to be alarmed, 
       and though it is far from becoming, 
               when Titus Annius Milo himself is more disturbed for the safety 
               of the republic than for his own, 
           that I should not be able to bring to the cause a similar greatness 
           of mind, 
   yet this novel appearance of a new manner of trial alarms my eyes, 
       which, 
           wherever they fall, 
       seek for the former customs of the forum and the ancient practice in 
       trials. 

>> For your assembly is not surrounded by a circle of bystanders 
       as usual; 
   we are not attended by our usual company;
   For those guards 
       which you behold in front of all the temples, 
       although they are placed there as a protection against violence, 
   yet they bring no aid to the orator, 
       so that even in the forum and in the court of justice itself, 
           although we are protected with all military and necessary defences, 
       yet we cannot be entirely without fear. 

>> But if I thought 
       this adverse to Milo, 
   I should yield to the times, O judges, 
   and among such a crowd of armed men, I should think 
       there was no room for an orator. 

>> But the wisdom of Cnaeus Pompeius, 
       a most wise and just man, 
   strengthens and encourages me, 
       who would certainly neither think 
           it suitable to his justice 
               to deliver that man up to the weapons of the soldiery
                   whom he had given over as an accused person to the decision 
                   of the judges, 
           nor suitable to his wisdom 
               to arm the rashness of an excited multitude with public authority. 

>> So that those arms, those centurions, those cohorts, do not announce danger 
   to us, 
   but protection; 
   nor do they expect 
       us only to be calm, 
       but even to be courageous, 
   nor do they promise only assistance to my defence but also silence.

>> And the rest of the multitude 
       which consists of citizens 
   is wholly ours; 
   nor is there any one individual among those 
       whom you see from this place gazing upon us from all sides 
           from which any part of the forum can be seen 
       and watching the result of this trial 
   who, 
       while he favours the virtue of Milo, 
   does not think 
       that this day in reality his own interests, those of his children, his 
       country, and his fortunes, are at stake.

>> There is one class adverse and hostilie to us, those
       whom the madness of Publius Clodius has fed on rapine, on conflagration, 
       and on every sort of public disaster; 
       and who were, 
           even in the assembly held yesterday, 
       exhorted to teach you, by their clamour, 
           what you were to decide; 
       but such shouts, 
           if any reached you,
       should rather warn you to retain him as a citizen
           who has always slighted that class of men, and their greatest 
           clamour, in comparison with your safety.

>> Wherefore, be of good courage, O judges, 
   and lay aside, 
       if indeed you feel any,
   your alarm. 

>>     For if ever you have the power of judging good and brave men, 
       if you have ever had the power of judging meritorious citizens,
       if ever an opportunity has been given to chosen men of the most 
       honourable ranks 
           to show that disposition towards brave and good citizens 
               which they had often declared by their looks and by their words, 
           by their actions and votes,
   all that power you now have,
       when you are to determine 
           whether we 
               who have always been wholly devoted to your authority 
           are to be miserable for ever, 
           or whether, 
               having been long harassed by the most abandoned citizens, 
           we shall at length be revived by you, your loyalty, your virtue, and 
           your wisdom.
