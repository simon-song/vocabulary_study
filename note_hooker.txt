Preface

>> 0.1.1
    Though for no other cause,
    yet for this,
that posterity may know 
    we have not loosely through silence permited things to pass away 
        as in a dream,
there shall be for men's information extant thus much concerning the present
state of the Church of God established amongsth us,
and their careful endeavour 
    which would upheld the same.

>> 0.1.2
At your hands,
    beloved in our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ,
    (for in him the love we bear unto all 
         that would but seem to be born of him,
    it is not the sea of your gall and bitterness that shall ever drown,)
I have no great cause to look for other than the selfsame portion and lot
    which your manner hath been to lay on them
        that concur not in opinion and sentence with you.

>> 0.1.3
But our hope is,
    that the God of peace shall,
        (notwithstanding man's nature too impatient of contumelious
        malediction,)
    enable us quietly even gladly to suffer all things,
        for that work sake 
            which we covet to perform.

>> 0.1.4
The wonderful zeal and fervour
    wherewith ye have withstood the received order of this church,
was the first thing 
    which caused me to enter into consideration,
    whether,
        as all your published books and writings peremptorily maintain,
    every Christian man,
        fearing God,
    stand bound to join with you for the furtherance of that
        which ye term the Lord's discipline.

>> 0.1.5
Wherein I must plainly confess unto you,
    that 
        before I examined your sundry declaration in that behalf,
    it could not settle in my head to think,
        but that undoubtedly such number of otherwise right well-affected and 
        most religiously inclined minds had some marvellous reasonable
        inducements
            which led them with so great earnestness that way.

>> 0.1.6
But when once,
    as near as my slender ability would serve,
I had with travail and care performed that part of the Apostle's advice and
consul,
    whereby he willeth to try all things,
and was come at the length so far,
    that there only remaineth the other clause to be satisfied,
    wherein he concludeth 
        what good is must be held;
there was in my poor understanding no remedy, 
but to set down this as my final resolution:
    surely the present form of church-government,
        which the laws of this land have established,
    is such,
        as no law of God, nor reason of man, hath hitherto been of force
        sufficient to prove they do ill,
        who to the uttermost of their power withstand the alteration thereof;
    contrariwise, the other,
        which 
            instead of it we are required to accept,
        is only by error and misconceit named the ordinance of Jesus Christ,
        no one proof as yet brought forth,
            whereby it may clearly appear to be so.
    
>> 0.1.7
The explication of which two things
     I have here thought good to offer into your own hands,
     heartily beseeching you even by the meekness of Jesus Christ,
         whom I trust ye love;
     that,
         as ye tender the peace and quietness of this church,
             if there be in you that gracious humility 
                 which hath ever been the crown and glory of a Christianly-
                 disposed mind,
             if your own souls, hearts, and consciences
                 (the sound integrity whereof can but hardly stand with the
                 refusal of truth in personal respects)
             be,
                 as I doubt not but they are,
             things most dear and precious unto you:
     let "not the faith 
         which ye have in our Lord Jesus Christ"
     be blemished "with partialities",
     regard not who it is that speaketh, but weigh what is spoken.

>> 0.1.8
Think not 
    that ye read the words of one
        who bendeth himself as an adversary against the truth
            which ye have already embraced;
but the words of one
    who desires even to embrace together with you the selfsame truth,
        if it be the truth;
and for that cause
    (for no other, God he knoweth)
hath undertaken the burdensome labour of this painful kind of conference.

>> 0.1.9
    For the plainer access thereunto,
let it be lawful for me to rip up to the very bottom,
    how and by whom this discipline was planted,
    at such time as this age we live in began to make first trial thereof.

>> 0.2.1
A founder it had,
    whom,
        for mine own parts,
     I think incomparably the wisest man
        that ever the French church did enjoy,
        since the hour it enjoyed him.

>> 0.2.2
His bringing up was in the study of the civil law.

>> 0.2.3
Divine knowledge he gathered,
    not by hearing or reading so much,
    as by teaching others.

>> 0.2.4
    For,
        though thousands were debtors to him,
            as touching knowledge in that kind;
    yet he to none but only to God,
        the author of that most blessed fountain, the Book of Life,
        and the admirable dexterity of wit,
    together with the helps of other learning 
        which were his guides:
    till being occasioned to leave France,
he fell at the length upon Geneva;
    which city the bishop and clegy had a little before
        (as some do affirm)
    forsaken,
        being of likelihood frightened with the people's sudden attempt for
        abolishment of popish religion:
            the event of which enterprise 
                they thought it not safe for themselves to wait for in that 
                place.

>> 0.2.5
    At the coming of Calvin thither,
the form of their civil regiment was popular,
    as it continueth at this day:
neithr king, nor duke, nor nobleman of any power or authority over them,
but officers chosen by the people yearly out of themselves,
    to order all things with public consent.

>> 0.2.6
    For spiritual government,
they had no laws at all agreed upon,
but did what the pastors of their souls by persuasion could win them unto.

>> 0.2.7
Calvin,
    being admitted one of their preachers, and a divinity reader amongst them,
considered how dangerous it was
    that the whole estate of that church should hang still on so slender a 
    thread
        as the liking of an ignorant multitude is,
        if it have the power to change whatsoever itself listeth.

>> 0.2.8
Wherefore
    taking unto him two of the other ministers for more countenance of the 
    action,
    (albeit the rest were all against it,)
they moved,
and in the end persuaded 
    with much ado,
the people to bind themselves by solemn oath,
    first never to admit the Papacy amongst them again;
    and secondly,
        to live in obedience unto such orders
            concerning the exercise of their religion and the form of their 
            ecclesiastical government,
        as those their true and faithful ministers of God's word had agreeably 
        to scripture set down for that end and purpose.

>> 0.2.9
    When these things began to be put in ure,
the people also,
    (what causes moving them thereunto, themselves best know)
began to repent them of that they had done,
    and irefully to champ upon the bit
        they had taken into their mouths;
    the rather,
    for that they grew by means of this innovation into dislike with some 
    churches near about them,
        the benifit of whose good friendship their state could not well lack.

>> 0.2.10
It was the manner of those times
    (whether through men's desire to enjoy alone the glory of their own
     enterprises, 
     or else because the quickness of their occasions required present dispatch;
     so it was,)
that every particular church did that within itself,
    which some few of their own thought good,
        by whom the rest were all directed.

>> 0.2.11
Such number of churches then being,
    though free within themselves,
yet small, common conference beforehand might have eased them of much after
trouble.

>> 0.2.12
But a greater inconvenience it bred,
that every later endeavoured to be certain degrees more removed from conformity 
with the Church of Rome,
    than the rest before had been:
    whereupon grew marvellous great dissimilitudes,
        and by reason thereof,
    jealousies, heart-burnings, jars and discords amongst them.

>> 0.2.13
Which,
    notwithstanding,
might have easily been prevented,
    if the orders,
        which every church did think fit and convenient for itself,
    had not so peremptorily been established under that high commanding form,
        which tendered them unto the people,
            as things everlastingly required by the law of that Lord of lords,
            against whose statues there is no exception to be taken.

>> 0.2.14
For by this mean it came to pass,
    that one church could not but accuse and condemn another of disobedience to
    the will of Christ,
        in those things where manifest difference was between them:
    whereas the selfsame orders allowed,
    but yet established in more wary and suspense manner,
        as being to stand in force 
            till God should give the opportunity of some general conference
                what might be best for every of them afterwards to do;
    this 
        I say
    had both prevented all occasion of just dislike
        which others might take,
    and reserved a greater liberty unto the authors themselves
        of entering into farther consulation afterwards.

>> 0.2.15
Which
    though never so necessary
they could not easily now admit,
    without some fear of derogration from their credit:
and therefore that 
    which once they had done,
they became for ever after resolute to maintain.

>> 0.2.16
Calvin therefore and the other two his associates,
    stiffly refusing to administer the holy communion to such
        as would not quietly,
            without contradition and murmur,
        submit themselves unto the orders
            which their solemn oath had bound them to obey,
were in that quarrel banished the town.

>> 0.2.17
    A few years after
        (such was the levity of that people,)
    the places of one or two of their ministers being fallen void,
they were not before so willing to be rid of their learned pastor,
as now importunate to obtain him again from them
    who had given him entertainment,
    and which were loath to part with him,
        had not unresistable earnestness been used.

>> 0.2.18
One of the town ministers 
    that saw
        in which way the people were bent for the revocation of Calvin,
gave him notice of their affection in this sort.

>> 0.2.19
    "The Senate of two hundred being assembled,
they all crave Calvin.
The next day a general convocation.
They cry in like sort again all, 
    we will have Calvin, that good and learned man, Christ's minister;
This", saith he,
    "when I understood,
I could not choose but praise God,
nor was I able to judge otherwise than 
    that 'this was the Lord's doing and that it is marvellous in our eyes,'
    and that 'the stone 
        which the builders refused
    was now made the head of the corner.'"

>> 0.2.20
The other two 
    whom they had thrown out,
    (together with Calvin,)
they were content should enjoy their exile.

>> 0.2.21
Many causes might lead them to be more desirous of him.

>> 0.2.22
First, his yielding unto them in one thing might happily put them in hope,
    that time would breed the like easiness of condescending further unto them.

>> 0.2.23
For in his absence he had persuaded them,
    with whom he was able to prevail,
that
    albeit himself did better like of common bread to be used in the Eucharist,
    yet the other they rather should accept,
        than cause any trouble in the church about it.

>> 0.2.24
    Again,
they saw that the name of Calvin waxed every day abroad,
    and that together with his fame,
their infamy was spread,
    which had so rashly and childishly ejected him.

>> 0.2.25
Besides,
it was not unlikely 
    but that his credit in the world might many ways stand the poor town in 
    great stead:
        as the truth is,
        their minister's foreign estimation hitherto hath been the best stake in
        their hedge.

>> 0.2.26
But whatsoever secret respects were likely to move them,
    for contenting of their minds Calvin returned
        (as it had been another Tully)
    to his old home.

>> 0.2.27
He ripely considered
    how gross a thing it were for men of his quality,
        wise and grave men,
    to live with such a multitude,
    and to be tenants at will under them,
    as their ministers,
    both himself and others,
    had been.

>> 0.2.28
    For the remedy of which inconvenience,
he gave them plainly to understand,
    that 
        if he did become their teacher again,
    they must be content to observe a complete form of discipline,
        which both they and also their pastors should now be solemnly sworn to 
        observe for ever after.

>> 0.2.29
Of which discipline the main and principal parts were these:
    a standing ecclesiastical court to be established;
    perpetual judges in that court to be their ministers;
    others of the people to be annually chosen
        (twice so many in number as they)
    to be judges together with them in the same court:
    these two sorts to have the care of all men's manners,
        power of determining all kind of ecclesiastical causes,
        and authority to convent, to control, to punish,
            as far as with excommunication, 
        whomsoever they should think worth,
            none either small or great excepted.

>> 0.2.30
This device I see not how the wisest at that time living could have bettered,
    if we duly consider 
        what the present estate of Geneva did then require.

>> 0.2.31
For their bishop and his clergy being
    (as it is said)
departed from them by moonlight,
    or howsoever, being departed,
to choose in his room any other bishop, had been a thing altogether
impossible.

>> 0.2.32
And for the ministers themselves to seek 
    that themselves alone might have coercive power over the whole church,
would perhaps have been hardly construed at that time.

>> 0.2.33
    But when so frank an offer was made,
        that for every one minister there should be two of the people to sit and
        give voice in the ecclesiastical consistory,
what inconvenience could they easily find
    which themselves might not be able always to remedy?

>> 0.2.34
Howbeit
    (as evermore the simpler sort are,
         even when they see no apparent cause,
     jealous notwithstanding over the secret intents and purposes of wiser men,)
this proposition of his did somewhat trouble them.

>> 0.2.35
Of the ministers themselves
    which had stayed behind in the city 
        when Calvin was gone,
some,
    upon knowledge of the people's earnest intent to recall him to his place 
    again,
had beforehand given their letters of submission,
and assured him of their allegiance for ever after,
    if it should like him to hearken unto that public suit.

>> 0.2.36
    But yet misdoubting what might happen,
        if this discipline did go forward;
they objected against it
    the example of other reformed churches living quietly and orderly without
    it.

>> 0.2.37
Some of chiefest place and countenance amongst the laity professed with greater
stomach their judgment,
    that such a discipline was little better than popish tyranny disguised and
    tendered unto them under a new form.

>> 0.2.38
This sort,
    it may be,
had some fear,
    that the filling up of the seats in the consistory with so great a number of
    laymen was but to please the minds of the people,
        to the end they might think their own sway somewhat;
        but when things came to trial of practice,
    their pastors' learning would be at all times of force to over-persuade
    simple men,
        who 
            knowing the time of their own presidentship to be but short
        would always stand in fear of their ministers' perpetual authority:
    and 
        among the ministers themselves,
    one being so far in estimation above the rest,
    the voices of the rest were likely to be given for the most part
    respectively,
        with a kind of secret dependency and awe:
    so that in show a marvellous indifferently composed senate ecclesiastical 
    was to govern,
    but in effect one only man should,
        as the spirit and soul of the residue,
    do all in all.

>> 0.2.39
But what did these vain surmises boot?

>> 0.2.40
Brought they were to so strait an issue,
    that of two things they must choose one:
    namely,
        wether they would 
            to their endless disgrace, with ridiculous lightness
        dismiss him
            whose restitution they had in so impotent manner desired;
        or else condescend unto that demand,
            wherein he was resolute either to have it, or to leave them.

>> 0.2.40
They thought it better to be somewhat hardly yoked at home,
    than forever abroad discredited.

>> 0.2.41
Wherefore in the end those orders were on all sides assented unto:
    with no less alacrity of mind 
        than cities unable to hold out longer are wont to show,
        when they take conditions 
            such as it liketh him to offer them
                which hath them in the narrow straits of advantage.

>> 0.2.42
Not many years were over-passed,
before these twice-sworn men adventured to give their last and hottest assault
unto to the fortress of the same discipline;
    childishly granting by common consent of their whole senate,
        and that under their town seal,
    a relaxation to one Bertelier,
        whom the Eldership had excommunicated:
    further also decreeing,
        with strange absurdity,
    that to the same Senate it should belong to give final judgment in matter of
    excommunication,
    and to absolve whom it pleased them:
    clean contrary to their own former deeds and oaths.

>> 0.2.42
    The report of which decree being forthwith brought unto Calvin;
    "Before," 
saith he, 
    "this decreee take place, 
    either my blood or banishment shall sign it."

>> 0.2.43
Again,
    two days before the communion should be celebrated,
his speech was publickly to like effect:
    "kill me 
         if ever this hand do reach forth the things
             that are holy 
         to them
             whom the Church hath judged dispisers."

>> 0.2.44
Whereupon,
    for fear of tumult,
the forenamed Bertelier was by his friends advised for that time not to use the 
liberty
    granted him by the Senate,
nor to present himself in the Church,
    till they saw somewhat further
        what would ensue.

>> 0.2.45
    After the communion quietly ministered,
    and some likelihood of peaceful ending of these troubles without any more 
    ado,
    that very day in the afternoon,
    besides all men's expectation,
    concluding his ordinary sermon,
he telleth them,
    that because he neither had learned nor taught to strive with such 
        as are in authority,
    "therefore," saith he,
    "the case so standing as now it doth,
    let me use the words of the Apostle unto your,
        'I commend you to God and the word of his grace;'"
and so bade them heartily all adieux.
    
>> 0.2.46
It sometimes cometh to pass,
   that the readiest way 
       which a wise man hath to conquer, 
   is to fly.

>> 0.2.47
This voluntary and unexpected mention of sudden departure caused presently the
Senate
    (for according to their wonted ways they still continued only constant in
    unconstancy)
to gather themselves together,
and for a time to suspend their own creed,
    leaving things to proceed as before
        till they had heard the judgment of four Helvetian cities concerning the 
        matter
            which was in strife.

>> 0.2.48
This to have done at the first 
    before they gave assent unto any order
had showed some wit and discretion in them:
but now to do it was as much as to say in effect,
    that they would play their parts on a stage.

>> 0.2.49
Calvin therefore dispatched with all expedition his letters unto some principal
pastor in every of those cities,
    craving earnestly at their hands,
        to respect this cause as a thing
            whereupon the whole state of religion and piety in that church did
            so much depend,
        that God and all good men were now inevitably certain to be trampled
        under foot,
            unless those four cities by their good means might be brought to 
            give sentence with the minsters of Geneva,
                when the cause should be brought before them:
            yea so to give it,
                that two things it might effectually contain;
                the one an absolute approbation of the discipline of Geneva as 
                consonant unto the word of God,
                    without any cautions, qualifications, ifs or ands;
                the other an earnest admonition not to innovate or change the
                same.

>> 0.2.50
His vehement request as touching both points was satisfied.

>> 0.2.51
For albeit the said Helvetian churches did never as yet observe that discipline,
    nevertheless,
the Senate of Genave having required their judgment concerning these three
questions:
    First, "After what manner, by God's commandament, according to the 
    scripture and unspotted religion, excommunication is to be exercised:"
    Secondly, "whether it may not be exercised some other way than by the
    consistory:"
    Thirdly, "what the use of their churches was to do in this case:"
answer was returned from the said churches,
    "that they had heard already of those consistory laws,
     and did acknowledge them to be godly ordinaces drawing towards the
     prescript of the word of God;
     for which cause they did not think it good for the Church of Geneva by
     innovation to change the same, but rather to keep them as they were."
    
>> 0.2.52
Which answer,
    although not answering unto the former demands,
    but respecting what Master Calvin had judged requisite for them to answer,
was notwithstanding accepted without further reply:
in as much as they plainly saw,
    that
        when stomach doth strive with wit,
    the match is not equal.

>> 0.2.53
And so the heat of their former contentions began to slake.

>> 0.2.54
    The present inhabitants of Geneva,
I hope,
    will not take it in evil part,
        that the faultiness of their people heretofore is by us so far forth
        laid open,
        as their own learned guides and pastors have found necessary to discover 
        it unto the word.

>> 0.2.55
For out of their books and writings it is that I have collected this whole
narration,
    to the end it might thereby appear in what sort amongst them that discipline 
    was planted,
        for which so much contention is raised amongst ourselves.

>> 0.2.56
The reason 
    which moved Calvin herein to be so earnest,
was,
    as Beza himself testifieth,
"for that he saw how needful these bridles were,
    to be put in the jaws of that city."

>> 0.2.57
That which by wisdom he saw to be requisite for that people,
was by as great wisdom compassed.

>> 0.2.58
But wise men are men, and the truth is truth.

>> 0.2.59
That which Calvin did for establishment of his discipline,
seemeth more commendable than that 
    which he did for the countenancing of it established.

>> 0.2.60
Nature worketh in us all a love to our own counsels.

>> 0.2.61
The contradition of others is a fan to inflame that love.

>> 0.2.62
Our love set on fire to maintain that 
    which once we have done,

Wherefore a marvel it were
    if a man of so great capacity,
        having such incitements to make him desirous of all kind of furtherances
        unto his cause,
    could espy in the whole scripture of God nothing 
        which might breed at the least a probable opinion of likelihood,
            that divine authority itself was the same way somewhat inclinable.

And all 
    which the wit even of Calvin was able from thence to draw,
        by sifting the very utmost sentence and syllable,
is no more than 
    that certain speeches there are
        which to him did seem to intimate
            that all Christian churches ought to have their Elderships endued 
            with power of excommunication,
            and that a part of those elderships every where should be chosen out
            from amongst the laity
                after that form 
                    which himself had framed Geneva unto.

But what argument are ye able to show,
    whereby it was ever proved by Calvin,
that any one sentence of Scripture doth necessarily enforce these things,
    or the rest
        wherein your opinion concurreth with his 
    against the orders of your own church?
