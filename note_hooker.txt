Preface

>> 0.1.1
    Though for no other cause,
    yet for this,
that posterity may know 
    we have not loosely through silence permited things to pass away 
        as in a dream,
there shall be for men's information extant thus much concerning the present
state of the Church of God established amongsth us,
and their careful endeavour 
    which would upheld the same.

>> 0.1.2
At your hands,
    beloved in our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ,
    (for in him the love we bear unto all 
         that would but seem to be born of him,
    it is not the sea of your gall and bitterness that shall ever drown,)
I have no great cause to look for other than the selfsame portion and lot
    which your manner hath been to lay on them
        that concur not in opinion and sentence with you.

>> 0.1.3
But our hope is,
    that the God of peace shall,
        (notwithstanding man's nature too impatient of contumelious
        malediction,)
    enable us quietly even gladly to suffer all things,
        for that work sake 
            which we covet to perform.

>> 0.1.4
The wonderful zeal and fervour
    wherewith ye have withstood the received order of this church,
was the first thing 
    which caused me to enter into consideration,
    whether,
        as all your published books and writings peremptorily maintain,
    every Christian man,
        fearing God,
    stand bound to join with you for the furtherance of that
        which ye term the Lord's discipline.

>> 0.1.5
Wherein I must plainly confess unto you,
    that 
        before I examined your sundry declaration in that behalf,
    it could not settle in my head to think,
        but that undoubtedly such number of otherwise right well-affected and 
        most religiously inclined minds had some marvellous reasonable
        inducements
            which led them with so great earnestness that way.

>> 0.1.6
But when once,
    as near as my slender ability would serve,
I had with travail and care performed that part of the Apostle's advice and
consul,
    whereby he willeth to try all things,
and was come at the length so far,
    that there only remaineth the other clause to be satisfied,
    wherein he concludeth 
        what good is must be held;
there was in my poor understanding no remedy, 
but to set down this as my final resolution:
    surely the present form of church-government,
        which the laws of this land have established,
    is such,
        as no law of God, nor reason of man, hath hitherto been of force
        sufficient to prove they do ill,
        who to the uttermost of their power withstand the alteration thereof;
    contrariwise, the other,
        which 
            instead of it we are required to accept,
        is only by error and misconceit named the ordinance of Jesus Christ,
        no one proof as yet brought forth,
            whereby it may clearly appear to be so.
    
>> 0.1.7
The explication of which two things
     I have here thought good to offer into your own hands,
     heartily beseeching you even by the meekness of Jesus Christ,
         whom I trust ye love;
     that,
         as ye tender the peace and quietness of this church,
             if there be in you that gracious humility 
                 which hath ever been the crown and glory of a Christianly-
                 disposed mind,
             if your own souls, hearts, and consciences
                 (the sound integrity whereof can but hardly stand with the
                 refusal of truth in personal respects)
             be,
                 as I doubt not but they are,
             things most dear and precious unto you:
     let "not the faith 
         which ye have in our Lord Jesus Christ"
     be blemished "with partialities",
     regard not who it is that speaketh, but weigh what is spoken.

>> 0.1.8
Think not 
    that ye read the words of one
        who bendeth himself as an adversary against the truth
            which ye have already embraced;
but the words of one
    who desires even to embrace together with you the selfsame truth,
        if it be the truth;
and for that cause
    (for no other, God he knoweth)
hath undertaken the burdensome labour of this painful kind of conference.

>> 0.1.9
    For the plainer access thereunto,
let it be lawful for me to rip up to the very bottom,
    how and by whom this discipline was planted,
    at such time as this age we live in began to make first trial thereof.

>> 0.2.1
A founder it had,
    whom,
        for mine own parts,
     I think incomparably the wisest man
        that ever the French church did enjoy,
        since the hour it enjoyed him.

>> 0.2.2
His bringing up was in the study of the civil law.

>> 0.2.3
Divine knowledge he gathered,
    not by hearing or reading so much,
    as by teaching others.

>> 0.2.4
    For,
        though thousands were debtors to him,
            as touching knowledge in that kind;
    yet he to none but only to God,
        the author of that most blessed fountain, the Book of Life,
        and the admirable dexterity of wit,
    together with the helps of other learning 
        which were his guides:
    till being occasioned to leave France,
he fell at the length upon Geneva;
    which city the bishop and clegy had a little before
        (as some do affirm)
    forsaken,
        being of likelihood frightened with the people's sudden attempt for
        abolishment of popish religion:
            the event of which enterprise 
                they thought it not safe for themselves to wait for in that 
                place.

>> 0.2.5
    At the coming of Calvin thither,
the form of their civil regiment was popular,
    as it continueth at this day:
neithr king, nor duke, nor nobleman of any power or authority over them,
but officers chosen by the people yearly out of themselves,
    to order all things with public consent.

>> 0.2.6
    For spiritual government,
they had no laws at all agreed upon,
but did what the pastors of their souls by persuasion could win them unto.

>> 0.2.7
Calvin,
    being admitted one of their preachers, and a divinity reader amongst them,
considered how dangerous it was
    that the whole estate of that church should hang still on so slender a 
    thread
        as the liking of an ignorant multitude is,
        if it have the power to change whatsoever itself listeth.

>> 0.2.8
Wherefore
    taking unto him two of the other ministers for more countenance of the 
    action,
    (albeit the rest were all against it,)
they moved,
and in the end persuaded 
    with much ado,
the people to bind themselves by solemn oath,
    first never to admit the Papacy amongst them again;
    and secondly,
        to live in obedience unto such orders
            concerning the exercise of their religion and the form of their 
            ecclesiastical government,
        as those their true and faithful ministers of God's word had agreeably 
        to scripture set down for that end and purpose.

>> 0.2.9
    When these things began to be put in ure,
the people also,
    (what causes moving them thereunto, themselves best know)
began to repent them of that they had done,
    and irefully to champ upon the bit
        they had taken into their mouths;
    the rather,
    for that they grew by means of this innovation into dislike with some 
    churches near about them,
        the benifit of whose good friendship their state could not well lack.

>> 0.2.10
It was the manner of those times
    (whether through men's desire to enjoy alone the glory of their own
     enterprises, 
     or else because the quickness of their occasions required present dispatch;
     so it was,)
that every particular church did that within itself,
    which some few of their own thought good,
        by whom the rest were all directed.

>> 0.2.11
Such number of churches then being,
    though free within themselves,
yet small, common conference beforehand might have eased them of much after
trouble.

>> 0.2.12
But a greater inconvenience it bred,
that every later endeavoured to be certain degrees more removed from conformity 
with the Church of Rome,
    than the rest before had been:
    whereupon grew marvellous great dissimilitudes,
        and by reason thereof,
    jealousies, heart-burnings, jars and discords amongst them.

>> 0.2.13
Which,
    notwithstanding,
might have easily been prevented,
    if the orders,
        which every church did think fit and convenient for itself,
    had not so peremptorily been established under that high commanding form,
        which tendered them unto the people,
            as things everlastingly required by the law of that Lord of lords,
            against whose statues there is no exception to be taken.

>> 0.2.14
For by this mean it came to pass,
    that one church could not but accuse and condemn another of disobedience to
    the will of Christ,
        in those things where manifest difference was between them:
    whereas the selfsame orders allowed,
    but yet established in more wary and suspense manner,
        as being to stand in force 
            till God should give the opportunity of some general conference
                what might be best for every of them afterwards to do;
    this 
        I say
    had both prevented all occasion of just dislike
        which others might take,
    and reserved a greater liberty unto the authors themselves
        of entering into farther consulation afterwards.

>> 0.2.15
Which
    though never so necessary
they could not easily now admit,
    without some fear of derogration from their credit:
and therefore that 
    which once they had done,
they became for ever after resolute to maintain.

>> 0.2.16
Calvin therefore and the other two his associates,
    stiffly refusing to administer the holy communion to such
        as would not quietly,
            without contradition and murmur,
        submit themselves unto the orders
            which their solemn oath had bound them to obey,
were in that quarrel banished the town.

>> 0.2.17
    A few years after
        (such was the levity of that people,)
    the places of one or two of their ministers being fallen void,
they were not before so willing to be rid of their learned pastor,
as now importunate to obtain him again from them
    who had given him entertainment,
    and which were loath to part with him,
        had not unresistable earnestness been used.

>> 0.2.18
One of the town ministers 
    that saw
        in which way the people were bent for the revocation of Calvin,
gave him notice of their affection in this sort.
