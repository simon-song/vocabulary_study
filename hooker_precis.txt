Book I.VIII. 
Of the natural finding out of Laws by the light of Reason, to guide the Will
unto that which is good.

1.8.1 We return to the discovering of the natural way by which rules have been
found out concerning the goodness with which the will of man ought to be moved
in human actions.

There is no need to have different sets of rules to tell good from evil.

1.8.2 There are only two ways of discerning goodness: (1) the knowledge of the
causes by which it is made such; (2) the observation of those signs and tokens
always annexed unto goodness.

The former is the more sure way. But we are not going to go down that road due
to the common imbecility.

1.8.3 The most certain token of evident goodness is common consent by all.

1.8.4 A law generally taken is a directive rule unto the goodness of operation.
Different examples of this assertion.

1.8.5 The main principles of Reason are in themselves apparent, e.g. God to be
worshipped.

Those principles were at the first found out by discourse, and drawn from out of
the very bowels of heaven and earth.

1.8.6 The knowledge of that which man is in reference unto himself, and other 
things in relation unto man, I may term the mother of all principles.

1.8.7 Two grand mandates which must be obeyed by the will of man: (1) that there
is a God upon whom we depend, and whom we adore, love, and imitate; (2) to love
others as ourselves.

1.8.8 The sentence of Reason is either mandatory, showing what must be done; or
else permissive, declaring only what may be done; or thirdly admonitory, opening
what is the most convenient for us to do.
