==   Precis of Rambler #14
=============================================

para. #1:
There is usually a strong contrast between an author's writing and his life;
though Milton amazingly showed none.

para. #2:
Those who are looking for virtue in the real life of a writer are often
bitterly disappointed.

para. #3: 
It is necessary for authors to conceal their private life from the readers.
OR
Writers should hide their follies and weaknesses from their readers, just like
some oriental monarchs their subjects.

para. #4:
There are many reasons why a man writes much better than he lives, the most
obvious one being that he does not have to go through all the real difficulties
during writing.

para. #5:
In practice, people will face many obstacles and inconveniences not anticipated
in theory.

para. #6: 
Hence most people fail to acheive the goals they have set in comfort.

para. #7:
Knowing this, we still need to aim for perfection, and our failings would be
instructive to others.

para. #8:
We should not be too harsh to people who advocate virtues which they fail to 
practice.

para. #9:
The folly of those who attack virtues just because advocates themselves could
not maintain them is that one should counter argument by argument, rather than
by action.

para. #10:
Because of this prejudice (however unreasonable) writers advocating virtues
should strive to practice them.

para. #11:
It is acceptable for a man to target perfect virtues but in reality to setter on
lesser ones.

para. #12:
One should try to stay anonymous if he has no confidence about enforcing his own
rules.

para. #13:
Curiosity about a writer's private life may also arise from an admiration of
that writer's ability to delight (instead of to teach) in his writings.

para. #14:
Good writers may not behave well in society.

para. #15:
Good writers may not be very interesting in conversation.

para. #16:
The transition from an author's books to his conversation is similar to enter a
large city from afar.

==   Precis of Rambler #17
=============================================

para. #1:
Some eastern monarch had an officer to remind him of his mortality in the
morning, and Solon of Athens advised us to keep our eyes upon the end of life.

para. #2: 
A conscious and frequent attention to the end of one's life would keep one
honest and rational.

para. #3:
The consideration of our mortality would keep our desires, griefs, and fears
(which are three disturbers to our happiness) in check, as suggested by
Epictetus.


Johonson's original sentence:
That the maxim of Epictetus is founded on just observation will easily be
granted, when we reflect, how that vehemence of eagerness after the common
objects of pursuit is kindled in our minds.

Rewrite:
When we reflect, how that vehemence of eagerness after the common objects of
pursuit is kindled in our minds, it will easily be granted that the maxim of
