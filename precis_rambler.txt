==   Precis of Rambler #14
=============================================

para. #1:
There is usually a strong contrast between an author's writing and his life;
though Milton amazingly showed none.

para. #2:
Those who are looking for virtue in the real life of a writer are often
bitterly disappointed.

para. #3: 
It is necessary for authors to conceal their private life from the readers.
OR
Writers should hide their follies and weaknesses from their readers, just like
some oriental monarchs their subjects.

para. #4:
There are many reasons why a man writes much better than he lives, the most
obvious one being that he does not have to go through all the real difficulties
during writing.

para. #5:
In practice, people will face many obstacles and inconveniences not anticipated
in theory.

para. #6: 
Hence most people fail to acheive the goals they have set in comfort.

para. #7:
Knowing this, we still need to aim for perfection, and our failings would be
instructive to others.

para. #8:
We should not be too harsh to people who advocate virtues which they fail to 
practice.

para. #9:
The folly of those who attack virtues just because advocates themselves could
not maintain them is that one should counter argument by argument, rather than
by action.

para. #10:
Because of this prejudice (however unreasonable) writers advocating virtues
should strive to practice them.

para. #11:
It is acceptable for a man to target perfect virtues but in reality to setter on
lesser ones.

para. #12:
One should try to stay anonymous if he has no confidence about enforcing his own
rules.

para. #13:
Curiosity about a writer's private life may also arise from an admiration of
that writer's ability to delight (instead of to teach) in his writings.

para. #14:
Good writers may not behave well in society.

para. #15:
Good writers may not be very interesting in conversation.

para. #16:
The transition from an author's books to his conversation is similar to enter a
large city from afar.
