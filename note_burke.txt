Burke, Thoughts on the Cause of the Present Discontents

para. 1:
>> It is an undertaking of some degree of delicacy to examine into the cause of
   public disorders.
  >> If a man happens not to succeed in such an inquiry, he will be thought weak
     and visionary;
  >> If he touches the true grievance, there is a danger that he may come near 
     to persons of weight and consequence,
       >> who will rather be exasperated at the discovery of their errors,
          than thankful for the occasion of correcting them;
  >> If he should be obliged to blame the favorites of the people, he will be
     considered as the tool of the power;
  >> If he censures those in power, he will be looked on as an instrument of the
     faction.
>> But in all exertions of duty something is to be hazarded.
  >> In case of tumult and disorder, our law has invested every man, in some
     sort, with the authority of a magistrate.
  >> When the affairs of the nation are distracted, private people are, 
         by the spirit of that law, 
     justified in stepping a little out of their ordinary sphere.
  >> They enjoy a privilege, of somewhat more dignity and effect, than that of 
     idle lamentation over the calamities of their country.
  >> They may look into them narrowly; 
     they may reason upon them liberally; 
     and if they should be so fortunate as to discover the true source of the
     mischief, 
     and to suggest any probable method of removing it, 
         though they may displease the rulers of the day, 
     they are certainly of service to the cause of the government.
  >> Government is deeply interest in everything which,
         even through the medium of some temporary uneasiness,
     may tend finally to compose the minds of the subject,
     and to conciliate their affections.
>> I have nothing to do here with the abstract value of the voice of the people.
>> But as long as reputation,
       the most precious possession of every individual,
   and as long as opinion,
       the great support of the state,
   depend entirely upon the voice, 
   it can never be considered as a thing of little consequence either to
   individuals or to governments.
>> Nations are not primarily ruled by laws: less by violence.
>> Whatever original energy may be supposed either in force or regulation, 
   the operation of both is,
       in truth,
   merely instrumental.
>> Nations are governed by the same methods, and on the same principles, by
   which an individual without authority is often able to govern those who are
   his equals or his superiors; 
       by a knowledge of their temper, 
       and by a judicious management of it;
   I mean, --- when public affairs are steadily and quietly conducted;
   not when government is nothing but a continued scuffle between the magistrate
   and the multitude;
       in which sometimes the one and some times the other is uppermost;
       in which they alternately yield and prevail;
       in a series of contemptible victories, and scandalous submissions.
>> The temper of the people 
       amongst whom he presides
   ought therefore to be the first study of a statesman.
>> And the knowledge of this temper it is by no means impossible for him to
   attain, 
       if he has not an interest in being ignorant of what is his duty to learn.
   
para. 2:
>> To complain of the age we live in,
   to murmur at the present possessors of power,
   to lament the past,
   to conceive extravagant hopes of the future, 
       are the common dispositions of the greatest part of mankind;
       indeed the necessary effects of the ignorance and levity of the vulgar.
>> Such complaints and humors have existed in all times;
   yet as all times have not been alike,
   true political sagacity manifests itself in distinguishing that complaint
       which only characterizes the general infirmity of human nature,
   from those 
       which are symptoms of the particular distemperature of our own air and 
       season.

para. 3:
>> Nobody,
       I believe,
   will consider it merely as the language of spleen or disappointment,
   if I say,
       that there is something particularly alarming in the present conjuncture.
>> There is hardly a man,
       in or out of power,
   who holds any other language.
>> That government is at once dreaded and contemned;
   that the laws are despoiled of all their respected and salutary terrors;
   that their inaction is a subject of ridicule, 
       and their exertion of adhorrence;
   that rank, and office and title, and all the solemn plausibilities of the
       world, have lost their reverence and effect;
   that our foreign politics are as much deranged as our domestic economy;
   that our dependencies are slackened in their affection, and loosened from
       their obedience;
   that we know neither how to yield nor how to enforce;
   that hardly anything above or below, abroad or at home, is sound and entire;
   but that disconnection and confusion, in offices, in parties, in families,
       in Parliament, in the nation, prevail beyond the disorders of any former
       time:
   these are facts universally admitted and lamented.
   
para. 4:
>> This state of things is the more extraordinary,
   because the great parties 
       which formerly divided and agitated the kingdom 
   are known to be in a manner entirely dissolved.
>> No great external calamity has visited the nation;
   no pestilence or famine.
>> We do not labor at present under any scheme of taxation new or oppressive in
   the quantity or in the mode.
>> Nor are we engaged in unsuccessful war; 
   in which, 
       our misfortunes might easily pervert our judgment;
   and our minds, 
       sore from the loss of national glory,
   might feel every blow of fortune as a crime in government.

para. 5:
>> It is impossible that the cause of this strange distemper should not
   sometimes become a subject of discourse.
>> It is a compliment due,
      and which I willingly pay,
   to those who administer our affairs,
      to take notice in the first place of their speculation.
>> Our ministers are of opinion, 
       that the increase of our trade and manufactures,
       that our growth by colonization, and by conquest,
           have concurred to accumulate immense wealth in the hands of some
           individuals;
       and this again 
           being dispersed among the people,
       has rendered them universally proud, ferocious, and ungovernable;
       that the insolence of some from their enormous wealth,
       and the boldness of others from a guilty poverty,
           have rendered them capable of the most atrocious attempts;
       so that they have trampled upon all subordination,
       and violently borne down the unarmed laws of a free government;
       barriers too feeble against the fury of a populace so fierce and
       licentious as ours.


para. 6:
>> Nothing indeed can be more unnatural than the present convulsions of this
   country, 
       if the above account be a true one.
>> I confess 
       I shall assent to it 
           with great reluctance, 
           and only on the compulsion of the clearest and firmest proofs; 
   because their account resolves itself into this short, but discouraging 
   proposition, 
       "That we have a very good ministry, but that we have a very bad people"; 
       that we set ourselves to bite the hand that feed us;
       that 
           with a malignant insanity, 
       we oppose the measures, 
       and ungratefully vilify the persons, 
           of those whose sole object is our own peace and prosperity.
>> If a few puny libellers,
      acting under a knot of factious politicians,
          without virtue, parts, or character,
          (such they are constantly represented by these gentlemen,)
   are sufficient to exicite this disturbance, 
   very perverse must be the disposition of that people,
       amongst whom such a disturbance can be excited by such means.
>> It is besides no small aggravation of the public misfortune, 
      that the disease,
          on this hypothesis,
      appears to be without remedy.
>> If the wealth of the nation be the cause of this turbulence,
   I imagine it is not proposed to introduce poverty,
       as a constable to keep the peace.
>> If our dominions abroad are the roots which feed all this rank luxuriance of
   sedition,
   it is not intended to cut them off in order to famish the fruit.
>> If our liberty has enfeebled the executive power,
   there is no design,
       I hope,
   to call in the aid of despotism,
   to fill up the deficiencies of law.
>> Whatever may be intended,
   these things are not yet professed.
>> We seem therefore to be driven to absolute despair;
   for we have no other materials to work upon,
   but those out of which God has been pleased to form the inhabitants of this
   land.
>> If these be radically and essentially vicious, 
   all that can be said is,
       that those men are very unhappy,
           to whose fortune or duty it falls to administer the affairs of this
           untoward people.
>> I hear it indeed sometimes asserted,
       that a steady perseverance in the present measures,
       and a rigorous punishment of those who oppose them,
       will in course of time infallibly put an end to these disorders.
>> But this, 
       in my opinion,
   is said without much observation of our present disposition,
       and without any knowledge at all of the general nature of mankind.
>> If the matter 
       of which this nation is composed
   be so very fermentable as these gentlemen describe it,
   leaven never will be wanting to work it up,
       as long as discontent, revenge, and ambition, have existence in the
       world.
>> Particular punishments are the cure for accidental distempers in the state;
   they inflame rather than allay those heats
       which arise from the settled mismanagement of the government,
                   or from a natural indisposition in the people.
>> It is of the utmost moment not to make mistakes in the use of strong
   measures;
   and firmness is then only a virtue
       when it accompanies the most perfect wisdom.
>> In truth, inconstancy is a sort of natural corrective of folly and ignorance.
