  Sentence analysis of Burke's Thoughts on the Cause of the 
Present Discontents
=============================================================

==============================
para. 1:

>> 1.1
It is an undertaking of some degree of delicacy to examine into the cause of
public disorders.

>> 1.2
    If a man happens not to succeed in such an inquiry, 
he will be thought weak and visionary;
    If he touches the true grievance, 
there is a danger that he may come near to persons of weight and consequence,
    who will rather be exasperated at the discovery of their errors,
    than thankful for the occasion of correcting them;
    If he should be obliged to blame the favorites of the people, 
he will be considered as the tool of the power;
    If he censures those in power, 
he will be looked on as an instrument of the faction.

>> 1.3
But in all exertions of duty something is to be hazarded.

>> 1.4
    In case of tumult and disorder, 
our law has invested every man, 
    in some sort, 
with the authority of a magistrate.

>> 1.5
    When the affairs of the nation are distracted, 
private people are, 
    by the spirit of that law, 
justified in stepping a little out of their ordinary sphere.

>> 1.6
They enjoy a privilege, 
    of somewhat more dignity and effect, 
    than that of idle lamentation over the calamities of their country.

>> 1.7
They may look into them narrowly; 
they may reason upon them liberally; 
    and if they should be so fortunate as to discover the true source of the
    mischief, 
    and to suggest any probable method of removing it, 
        though they may displease the rulers of the day, 
they are certainly of service to the cause of the government.

>> 1.8
Government is deeply interest in everything 
    which,
        even through the medium of some temporary uneasiness,
    may tend finally to compose the minds of the subject,
    and to conciliate their affections.

>> 1.9
I have nothing to do here with the abstract value of the voice of the people.

>> 1.10
    But as long as reputation,
        the most precious possession of every individual,
    and as long as opinion,
        the great support of the state,
    depend entirely upon the voice, 
it can never be considered as a thing of little consequence either to 
individuals or to governments.

>> 1.11
Nations are not primarily ruled by laws: 
less by violence.

>> 1.12
    Whatever original energy may be supposed either in force or regulation, 
the operation of both is,
    in truth,
merely instrumental.

>> 1.13
Nations are governed by the same methods, and on the same principles, 
    by which an individual without authority is often able to govern those 
        who are his equals or his superiors; 
            by a knowledge of their temper, 
            and by a judicious management of it;
I mean, --- 
    when public affairs are steadily and quietly conducted;
    not when government is nothing but a continued scuffle between the 
    magistrate and the multitude;
        in which sometimes the one and some times the other is uppermost;
        in which they alternately yield and prevail;
        in a series of contemptible victories, and scandalous submissions.

>> 1.14
The temper of the people 
    amongst whom he presides
ought therefore to be the first study of a statesman.

>> 1.15
    And the knowledge of this temper 
it is by no means impossible for him to attain, 
    if he has not an interest in being ignorant 
        of what is his duty to learn.
   

==============================
para. 2:

>> 2.1
To complain of the age 
    we live in,
to murmur at the present possessors of power,
to lament the past,
to conceive extravagant hopes of the future, 
    are the common dispositions of the greatest part of mankind;
    indeed the necessary effects of the ignorance and levity of the vulgar.

>> 2.2
Such complaints and humors have existed in all times;
    yet as all times have not been alike,
true political sagacity manifests itself in distinguishing that complaint
    which only characterizes the general infirmity of human nature,
    from those 
        which are symptoms of the particular distemperature of our own air and 
        season.


==============================
para. 3:

>> 3.1
Nobody,
    I believe,
will consider it merely as the language of spleen or disappointment,
    if I say,
that there is something particularly alarming in the present conjuncture.

>> 3.2
There is hardly a man,
    in or out of power,
    who holds any other language.

>> 3.3
    That government is at once dreaded and contemned;
    that the laws are despoiled of all their respected and salutary terrors;
    that their inaction is a subject of ridicule, and their exertion of 
    adhorrence;
    that rank, and office and title, and all the solemn plausibilities of the
    world, have lost their reverence and effect;
    that our foreign politics are as much deranged as our domestic economy;
    that our dependencies are slackened in their affection, and loosened from
    their obedience;
    that we know neither how to yield nor how to enforce;
    that hardly anything above or below, abroad or at home, is sound and entire;
    but that disconnection and confusion, 
        in offices, in parties, in families, in Parliament, in the nation, 
    prevail beyond the disorders of any former time:
these are facts universally admitted and lamented.
   
==================
para. 4:

>> 4.1
This state of things is the more extraordinary,
    because the great parties 
        which formerly divided and agitated the kingdom 
    are known to be in a manner entirely dissolved.

>> 4.2
No great external calamity has visited the nation;
no pestilence or famine.

>> 4.3
We do not labor at present under any scheme of taxation new or oppressive in
the quantity or in the mode.

>> 4.4
Nor are we engaged in unsuccessful war; 
    in which, 
        our misfortunes might easily pervert our judgment;
        and our minds, 
            sore from the loss of national glory,
        might feel every blow of fortune as a crime in government.

===========================
para. 5:

>> 5.1
It is impossible 
    that the cause of this strange distemper should not sometimes become a 
    subject of discourse.

>> 5.2
It is a compliment due,
   and which I willingly pay,
to those who administer our affairs,
   to take notice in the first place of their speculation.

>> 5.3
Our ministers are of opinion, 
    that the increase of our trade and manufactures,
    that our growth by colonization, and by conquest,
        have concurred to accumulate immense wealth in the hands of some
        individuals;
    and this again 
        being dispersed among the people,
    has rendered them universally proud, ferocious, and ungovernable;
    that the insolence of some from their enormous wealth,
    and the boldness of others from a guilty poverty,
        have rendered them capable of the most atrocious attempts;
    so that 
        they have trampled upon all subordination,
        and violently borne down the unarmed laws of a free government;
            barriers too feeble against the fury of a populace so fierce and
            licentious as ours.

============================
para. 6:

>> 6.1
Nothing indeed can be more unnatural than the present convulsions of this
country, 
    if the above account be a true one.

>> 6.2
I confess 
    I shall assent to it 
        with great reluctance, 
        and only on the compulsion of the clearest and firmest proofs; 
    because their account resolves itself into this short, but discouraging 
    proposition, 
        "That we have a very good ministry, but that we have a very bad people"; 
        that we set ourselves to bite the hand that feed us;
        that 
            with a malignant insanity, 
        we oppose the measures, and ungratefully vilify the persons, 
            of those whose sole object is our own peace and prosperity.

>> 6.3
    If a few puny libellers,
       acting under a knot of factious politicians,
           without virtue, parts, or character,
           (such they are constantly represented by these gentlemen,)
    are sufficient to exicite this disturbance, 
very perverse must be the disposition of that people,
    amongst whom such a disturbance can be excited by such means.

>> 6.4
It is besides no small aggravation of the public misfortune, 
   that the disease,
       on this hypothesis,
   appears to be without remedy.

>> 6.5
    If the wealth of the nation be the cause of this turbulence,
I imagine 
    it is not proposed to introduce poverty,
        as a constable to keep the peace.

>> 6.6
    If our dominions abroad are the roots 
        which feed all this rank luxuriance of sedition,
it is not intended to cut them off 
    in order to famish the fruit.

>> 6.7
    If our liberty has enfeebled the executive power,
there is no design,
    I hope,
to call in the aid of despotism,
to fill up the deficiencies of law.

>> 6.8
    Whatever may be intended,
these things are not yet professed.

>> 6.9
We seem therefore to be driven to absolute despair;
    for we have no other materials to work upon,
but those 
    out of which God has been pleased to form the inhabitants of this land.

>> 6.10
    If these be radically and essentially vicious, 
all that can be said is,
    that those men are very unhappy,
        to whose fortune or duty it falls to administer the affairs of this
        untoward people.

>> 6.11
I hear it indeed sometimes asserted,
    that a steady perseverance in the present measures, and a rigorous 
    punishment of those 
        who oppose them,
    will in course of time infallibly put an end to these disorders.

>> 6.12
But this, 
    in my opinion,
is said without much observation of our present disposition,
    and without any knowledge at all of the general nature of mankind.

>> 6.13
    If the matter 
        of which this nation is composed
    be so very fermentable 
        as these gentlemen describe it,
leaven never will be wanting to work it up,
    as long as discontent, revenge, and ambition, have existence in the
    world.

>> 6.14
Particular punishments are the cure for accidental distempers in the state;
they inflame rather than allay those heats
    which arise from the settled mismanagement of the government,
    or from a natural indisposition in the people.

>> 6.15
It is of the utmost moment not to make mistakes in the use of strong measures;
and firmness is then only a virtue
    when it accompanies the most perfect wisdom.

>> 6.16
In truth, inconstancy is a sort of natural corrective of folly and ignorance.

==============================
para. 7:

>> 7.1
I am not one of those
    who think that the people are never in the wrong.

>> 7.2
They have been so,
    frequently and outrageously,
    both in other countries and in this.

>> 7.3
But I do say,
        that in all disputes between them and their rulers,
    the presumtption is at least upon a par in favor of the people.

>> 7.4
Experience may perhaps justify me in going further.

>> 7.5
    When popular discontents have been very prevalent,
it may well be affirmed and supported,
    that there has been generally something found amiss 
        in the constitution,
        or in the conduct of the government.

>> 7.6
    When they do wrong,
it is their error, 
    and not their crime.

>> 7.7
But with the governing part of the state, it is otherwise.

>> 7.8
They certainly may act ill by design, as well as by mistake.

>> 7.9
“Les révolutions 
    qui arrivent dans les grands états 
ne sont point un effect du hazard, 
    ni du caprice des peuples. 
Rien ne révolte les grands d’un royaume comme un gouvernement foible et dérangé.
    Pour la populace,
ce n’est jamais par envie d’attaquer 
    qu’elle se soulève, 
    mais par impatience de souffrir.”

>> 7.10
These are the words of a great man;
    of a minister of state;
    and a zealous assertor of monarchy.

>> 7.11
They are applied to the system of favoritism
    which was adopted by Henry the Third of France,
and to the dreadful consequences it produces.

>> 7.12
What he says of revolution, is equally true of all great disturbances.

>> 7.13
    If this presumption in favor of the subjects against the trustees of power 
    be not the more probable,
I am sure 
    it is the more comfortable speculation;
        because it is more easy to change an administration,
            than to reform a people.

===========================
para. 8:

>> 8.1
    Upon a supposition, 
        therefore,
    that,
        in the opening of the cause,
    the presumptions stand equally balanced between the parties,
there seems sufficient ground to entitle any person to a fair hearing,
    who attempts some other scheme beside the easy one 
        which is fashionable in some fashionable companies,
    to account for the present discontents.

>> 8.2
It is not to be argued
    that we endure no grievance,
    because our grievances are not of the same sort with those
        under which we labored formerly;
    not precisely those 
        which we bore from the Tudors,
        or vindicated on the Stuarts.

>> 8.3
A great change has taken place in the affairs of this country.

>> 8.4
    For in the silent lapse of events 
as material alterations have been insensibly brought about in policy and
charactrer of governments and nations,
as those 
    which have been marked by the tumult of public revolutions.

===============================
para. 9:

>> 9.1
It is very rare indeed for men to be wrong in their feelings 
    concerning public misconduct;
as rare to be right in their speculation upon the cause of it.

>> 9.2
I have constantly observed,
    that the generality of people are fifty years,
        at least,
    behindhand in their politics.

>> 9.3
There are but very few
    who are capable of comparing and digesting 
        what passes before their eyes
            at different times and occasions,
            so as to form the whole into a distinct system.

>> 9.4
But in books everything is settled for them,
    without the exertion of any considerable diligence or sagacity.

>> 9.5
    For which reason
men are wise with but little reflection,
and good with little self-denial,
    in the business of all times except their own.

>> 9.6
We are very uncorrupt and tolerably enlightened judges of the transactions of
past ages;
    where no passions deceive,
    and where the whole train of circumstances,
        from the trifling cause to the tragical event,
    is set in an orderly series before us.

>> 9.7
Few are the partisans of departed tyranny;
and to be a Whig on the business of an hundred years ago,
    is very consistent with every advantage of present servility.

>> 9.8
This retrospective wisdom, and historical patriotism,
are things of wonderful convenience,
and serve admirably to reconcile the old quarrel between speculation and
practice.

>> 9.9
Many stern republican,
    after gorging himself with a full feast of admiration of the Grecian
    commonwealth and of our true Saxon constitution,
    and discharging all the splendid bile of his virtuous indignation on King
    John and King James,
sits down perfectly satisfied to the coarsest work and homeliest job of the
day he lived in.

>> 9.10
I believe 
    there was no professed admirer of Henry the Eighth among the
    instruments of the last King James;
nor in the court of Henry the Eighth was there,
    I dare say,
to be found a single advocate for the favorites of Richard the Second.
